The media plays huge part though confirming (narrow minded) stereotypes many believe. When I think media, ’re likely show represent Iran “death America” mob actually show representation OPs viewpoint. I saw another post yesterday someone explained death America mobs minority nobody wants war media likes portray different image. It’s horribly sad , ’s us likeminded sides debate, seek truth find common ground stand believe. There’s us can look past religious belief coexist peace respect - can’t vocal ones.

Pick choose confirms bias readers.People Twitter went outraging Iran strike outraging irrelevant comments Terry Gilliam less hours.

"hey US, actually hate , people chanting death america small minority" "hi iran, hate either, just insane baby charge government currently, try patient best work , apologies meantime"This common oversight though. You % blame average citizen geopolitical knowledge bias. Most Americans obtain news regarding military/foreign events media. The media, news military events, largely obtains news Pentagon, NOT impartial press releases. The Pentagon controls narrative, going give info makes military government look bad. Similarly, many times seen American newspapers link articles opposing side? I yet see many links CNN Iraq's Iran's X country's media stories. In short, often argue things playing half deck; , argue within framework established ****** us. Should blame people lazy researching? Sure. But **ALSO** blame people feeding us propaganda incomplete truths.^ . Reddit largely utilized children young people. Their grasp nuanced geopolitical events myopic nature.

No Americans hurt mob never actually made onto primary Embassy grounds. The Marines Embassy guarded without even shoot mob. Did Iranian leadership brag ? No-- said responsible--just mob Iranians bragging... mean Iranian government involved course-- evidence involved yet. Based ...I think American response strong...I think waiting small opportunity go Iran took . casualties Embassy attack appears emotional citizen-response recent December th American bombings? This reason start full-blown war. At least Iraq fake reports WMD's scare us.Sorry thats exactly ignorance OP complained .

Farsi/Persian main language. People live north west part Iran ( ) speak Turkish well. Or people living southern parts Iran speak Arabic well. There languages tho. These two just examples. But Farsi main languageI think OP meant Farsi section surprised fact Iranians speak Farsi Arabic required YSK post. He's saying 've expected common knowledge.I think point OP makes sense people get two languages mixed . Iran even Arab country, say middle east people think every single one Arab.Glad I helpful. Definitely expect comment receive + upvotes I'm just happy I can give clearer picture country people world. I'm really busy studying finals I will eventually respond comments addressed . So questions, just ask. I'll glad answer :)That's going bit difficult answer First , ever visited Iran make sure find good restaurant. More costumers *usually* means better healthier food. Also I advise talk tourists Iran ( know ). Unfortunately get food poisoning, much can . One foods Iran really famous Ghormeh Sabzi. It's combination meat, fenugreek, rice, dried lemon bean. I recommend googling food actual food looks much better pictures Google. One foods I personally really like Gheimeh. This one combination meat, dried lemon, rice, french fries split pea. Kebabs good (literally type Kebab) If visited Iran Autumn chance visit northern states Iran ( ones around Caspian/Khazar sea), make sure try Caspian Kutum/Mahi Sefid ( translates white fish) However like foods, can find Italian restaurants steak houses. They're specially easier find bigger cities. Such Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan Tabriz ( city)Listen, whatever just bring whole "wamen oppressed Iran" argument. It's just frustrating relation truth. And coming guy lives meters away courthouse Iran's fifth biggest city. I'm going disagree religious minorities mistreated Iran. I'm gonna deny happens LGBT people Iran express ( extremely unpopular opinion I'm perfectly fine LGBT activities banned Iran I can see community acts western countries. All takes considered homophobic transphobic saying one negative thing LGBT community done. We much bigger fishes fry Iran worried problems minority hardly even exists country. I used defend rights every opportunity now community just extreme long act like cult members religious fanatics, I'm going lift finger . Being part minority group justify shitty behavior) % murder cases Iran women killing husbands. Meaning dangerous place man Iran somewhere next wife. This simple fact I'm % sure neither Americans moraly right Hollywood celebrities going talk let alone accepting . Here Iran, men falsely accused sexual harassment women decades movement even thing Women Iran special seats busses metro men allowed use. They even special park men allowed. If divorce wife America gonna lose half belongings? That's cute Iran % chance will lose ALL money belongings parents might lose considerable amount money well. Not mention probably gonna spend couple months years jail BuT bUt BuT HeArD iRaN hAs SeXiSt RuLeS aGaInTs WaMeN..... Well, heard wrong. There's one sexist rule women Iran forced wear hijab. And truth told, rule taken seriously anymore. With said , every Iranian face planet favor stop giving away false information women country. Because neither "facts" relation truthyoure right doesnt give US right occupy, invade, overthrow leaders country literal decades. US also shot commercial iranian plane refused apologize. domt delude , america satanThere things US/Iran relationship I think many Americans understand. Let's assume Hilary Clinton 've won election . Do think Iran US much better relationship? I highly doubt . Iran country FILLED corruption. Literally every single one politicians corrupt corruptions destroyed country. If politicians stop corrupt start actual jobs, things start getting better. But since busy filling pockets, corruption will continue also someone else will blamed problems. Someone outside borders Iran right now US (America's president specific) perfect candidate . Matter fact, exactly government past years. Every US president addressed "sworn enemy Iranian people" past years media politicans. What I'm trying say Iran *needs* villain. Let's assume Iran/US war actually starts Iran wins war (Iran can never win war US. Even countries side US, considering managed piss fair amount countries past years. You can hardly find country hate us). What think happens next? Every single one Iranian people's problems will solved? Nope. Immediately afterwards, Iran will start looking another villain put blame . This new villain probably going Israel, England maybe France. years ago Iran US sort peace treaty Obama president. Do think solved problems? Not solved nothing also Obama pretty much like putting sheeps(Iranian people) wolves( government) cage. It just gave government power used power corrupt. And honestly, I hate Obama left wing I also know I'm one feels way. I'm supporting Trump's decision tho. After , assassinated Iran's golden boy (even though I hated guy every single fiber heart). Iran definitely stay silent. When think , can also clear message US Iran sure hell got message. And message reads "get troops middle east, Iran". This can also start another war middle east Trump probably stop makes sure Iran try anything funny middle east anymoreAll poor OP asking people research Iran can acknowledge respect cultural differences countries middle east. All I giving people insight actually happens Iran. Which part OP'S post made come realization "cosplaying"? Which part comments made think I'm lying nationality?Funny don’t hear thatThere's weird trend trying MLK like figure. Everybody desperate fight noble fight end like Kony . Lots hype fervor, end misplaced something unworthy. Since slavery suffrage fight invent things like Trans bathrooms equivalent. I problem Trans people comfortable shitter, c'mon... subject effects people world stopper treated like. Hell, even resorted bringing back racism sexism simply got MLK like cred maybe 'll happen . If really wanted activists address things like female genital mutilation actual patriarchy's like Middle East Asian countries, actually take effort.Haha! Go back even : Syrian civil war. Disbanding Assad *great* idea & *nothing* bad happened!Or think Brazil going full dictatorship understand idols (r/soccer) voted Bolsonaro "wow must homophobes hitler fans" Really showed can wrong perspective another country live know languageUsually wait - years start white washing US backed coups, guess anymore. Christ Reddit.>No Genocide kind, Civil War happen Shortly coup Jeanine Anez gave [impunity Armed Forces]( - effectively license kill - said Army Police can use “whatever means necessary” protesters. According official numbers, people died almost people injured. But people remain missing. >Evo Morales party banned The government related groups carrying political persecution members Evo Morales party supporters. Hundreds political social leaders arrested. The government instituted strict media censorship, shutting left wing media. Several journalists victims violence censorship government related groups.

All happened get Carlos Mesa elected. The last time Indian killing magnitude state, charge.White-washing coup already? Come , dudeExcept US backed coup... So, best example.There’s massive civil unrest Bolivia Anez government gave military carte blanche kill protestors lead coup government found maybe possible elections might tampered (claims trusted organizations disagreed ) agreed redo elections anyways. She members party congress driven hiding, called indigenous religion satanic, claimed Bolivia god, authorized police kill civilians without consequence .The intern government murdered indigenous protesters, made threats foreign journalists stacked current government people favor despite power. Also fact coup president proudly proclaimed getting Jesus back office saying indigenous go mountains worship .You're right. There differing voices Reddit seems . But uncovering voices - reading upvote comments, going new posts - takes effort. Today, people afforded time make effort. What happens easily seen becomes narrative masses. What's espoused shitty ass r/ becomes Reddit. The shitty non-politics distractive rhetoric mainstream media becomes politics rhetoric American masses. black white lenses get upvoted top. All nuance bottom underneath grey italics.But hivemind always ends conclusion. We're sitting echo chamber. Most people going due diligence learn facts. Redditors' facts top Reddit leads one side story side everyone knows almost always. It's way hard go educate can upvote thread content upvoted must correct version. So yes, whole, Reddit black white.I think im reading leftwingers bash rightwingers rightwingers bash leftwingers comment chain, agreeing , assuming person agrees .

Why people just get along?This better job explaining whole thing much less biased tone thank thatI think drone strikes will continue daily untill iran retaliates GOP can benifit warIdk intentionally getting facts wrong, arent telling truth happened. The US Embassy wasnt 'staged', staff left embassy protests, killed. The missile came helicopte. Soleimani wasnt" influential" FEARED THE head terrorist entire middle east. The mass majority population knew order dead . Killing terrorist thousands innocent lives hands doesnt equal CJC Staff Canada, plus didnt happen Iranian soil. You're explanation garbage.Reason unrest , Trump pulling treaty everything seemed escalate Trump pulled treaty Iran Obama admin place.They attack base just happened , attacked convoy knew .Doesn't sound like accident . We/I heard Australia. War just seems pointless . People killing reason seems.Not just happened , targeted, base Bagdad airport, public place another country authorize .Sulemani killed baghdad airport. Stop spreading lies.This misinformation. The US took base, Iran attacked US embassy, US killed top Iranian general. And accident, US specifically targeted Soleimani drone strike. They blew car badly barely even tell car.Drone attack base, international airport another country (Iraq). Another reason big deal.In early IRG (republican guard) officially added US list known terrorist groups due decades long attacks US Israel. Like killing marines etc. Iran long known largest state sponsor terrorist activities Earth. Once added list US officially war based policy post / declared war Terror. From day IRG added list, leaders members officially "targets opportunity" meaning given opportunity kill destroy means wage terror, act kill . Opportunity presented , acted. Rumor intelligence leading attack came Saudi Arabia... just attacked largest refineries last month Iran. Trump US military needed authorization Congress make attack... need declare war... already war every organization list known terrorists. All liberal media disinformation notifying congress etc willfull attempt MSM mislead Americans world.... know full well IRG known terrorist organization can lawfully attacked time. Most Iranians glad .... recently s Iran society similar West...secular... ovtaken oppressive muslim regime. We quarrel Iranian citizens. We declared war Iran country. We ARE war every known terrorist organization EARTH will kill can. If Iran attacks US Israel will meet overwhelming force...however US will never attempt occupy "liberate" Iran. There will ground war Iran. If strike American Israeli forces however... will Tomahawk cruise missiles, drone attacks, overwhelming air power destroy military facilities ability wage war. Fortunately Smart Weapons now... accurate minimize civilian casualties much possible. We quarrel citizens. If want war like oppressive leaders ... let voices heard home revolt... can change government. The US going change .yes . They terrorist supporting nation. They're going orchestrate act terrorism somewhere. And going learn Quadaffi learned mid late s. If blow passenger airliner, going blow presidential palace. He sat hands ever since happened kept mouth shut. Karma eventually caught , far state sponsored terrorism goes, took one bunker buster house put pin .Surely suicide? America arent known backing away fight.I know. Iran funds Hamas Hezbollah, I think followed promise annihilate recent years.Either made designed.[removed]Exactly. I doubt make mistake .And just summed lot Americans like Trump. Sometimes attitude entirely appropriate.Well, like “temper tantrum”Trump trying start war around political reasons distract impeachment. He told us thinks president attack Iran order get re-elected: "Our president will start war Iran absolutely ability negotiate,” Mr. Trump said video. “I believe will attack Iran sometime prior election thinks ’s way can get elected. Isn’t pathetic?”I'm hoping, along everyone else, end . There casualties ( I've read) Iran said sufficiently responded happened last week. Now I suppose Trump. I think matter settled find later today. Thanks link.> Salami getting Epstein'd. It Qasam Soleimani got killed, Hussein Salami.

So agree Democrats stop using faux electoral college (e.g. superdelegates) select presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton votes Barack Obama, somehow Obama still received presidential nomination?That's even close accurate. Did someone actually teach nonsense, make entirely ? The electoral college exists large states overwhelm wishes living smaller states. It designed way purpose: United States exist without . When colonies came together, smaller states afraid exactly " votes win" crowd wants: desires major population centers like NYC LA dictate happens Kansas without Kansas getting say . And guess population larger states *still* wants years later? As far " got votes," also ridiculous statement. People turn way precisely way system designed. For example, live California want Democrat win, really need go polls: Democrat going win whether take time day vote . And goes almost red state opposite direction. Only passionate sense civic duty actually going polls, looking raw vote totals precisely wrong way gauge public opinion. I go , I think I've made point: wrong many levels, perhaps save opinion-making better understand thing forming opinion .> It created years ago impossible accurately tally everyone’s votes, now . It primarily put place majorly populated places control elections every year.

One major reasons current ( relatively recent past) US strength oil world bought sold dollar. Every oil drop, every country (except Venezuela I think) bought sold US Currency. Why matter? Because, want buy oil need buy US currency first. So like lets say Qatar makes oil Finland wants buy , Finland needs buy / convert USD buy oil. Qatar gets benefit higher cost oil (since listed Qatar currency) US gets benefit since Finland bought/converted currency. Don't underestimate incredibly important US world economy, countries try leave US oil dollar usually go war . [link]( means state/government owns industry, rather private company.

Judgment cases impeachment shall extend removal office, disqualification hold enjoy office honor, trust, profit United States; party convicted shall nevertheless liable subject indictment, trial, judgment, punishment according law.

I'm pointing problematic behavior. He trying hijack thread center expense OP trying educate people whose president literally declared war OP's country cultural inheritance... I understand complete lack empathy , honestly.According Constitution, impeachment process, vote: “If House communicate impeachment Senate, hasn’t actually impeached president. If articles transmitted, Trump legitimately say wasn’t truly impeached . “The Constitution doesn’t say fast articles must go Senate. Some modest delay inconsistent Constitution, chambers usually work. But indefinite delay pose serious problem. **Impeachment contemplated Constitution consist merely vote House, process sending articles Senate trial. Both parts necessary make impeachment Constitution: The House must actually send articles send managers Senate prosecute impeachment. And Senate must actually hold trial.** Yeah, awkward. Now, liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz writing recent Supreme Court just “ripped rug” part Democrats’ impeachment nonsense concerning subpoenas: “The decision Supreme Court review lower court rulings involving congressional prosecution subpoenas directed toward President Trump undercuts second article impeachment passed House Judiciary Committee along party lines… “That second article impeachment charges President Trump obstruction Congress refusing comply congressional subpoenas absence final court order. In charging , House Judiciary Committee arrogated power decide validity subpoenas, power determine whether claims executive privilege must recognized, authorities properly belong judicial branch government, legislative branch. The House Representatives will likewise, votes approve articles, chamber expected Wednesday. “President Trump asserted executive branch, head, need comply congressional subpoenas requiring production privileged executive material, unless final court order compelling production. He argued, appropriately, judicial branch ultimate arbiter conflicts legislative executive branches. Therefore, Supreme Court decision review three cases, lower courts ruled President Trump, provides support constitutional arguments investigation. […] **Even high court eventually rule claims President Trump, fact justices decided hear , effect, supports constitutional contention right challenge congressional subpoenas court, demand issuing subpoenas seek enforce court. **It undercuts contention House Democrats President Trump committed impeachable offense insisting court order sending possibly privileged material Congress.
