1	1578479667.0	Interesting choice of targets. It looks like an attempt to pacify the IRGC and punish Kurdish and Sunni Iraqis, who by the way didn't vote for the troop withdrawal resolution, while not inflicting too much damage on the US.	elkxvb	2020-01-08 11:34:27

At this point I assume we will respond but not disproportionately. You have to wonder if Iran purposefully avoided US troops while still satisfying their vows of revenge."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 10:41:40
4	1578482661.0	"I feel like if the early reports of no American casualties are true, it probably gives both sides a way out. This is a dangerous game of chicken, with both sides using the fact that neither ultimately wants a total war as leverage to launch attacks against one another. 

The real loser here is Iraq. Iraq was walking a tightrope between Iran and the USA for its security interests, now as time goes on the pressure will build on their central government to pick a side so to speak. With both the USA and Iran now becoming increasingly unpopular plus the overall unpopularity of the Iraqi government, this might be the straw that breaks the camels back again. Plus with an increasing focus on dissidents from the Shia Arab community and the USA focus on  Iran, a potential revival into militarism in the Sunni Arab community remains a possibility. 


*If*, the USA decides to retaliate, I think the next target would be Kharag Island, which is key to the Iranian oil industry. It would create massive spikes in the price of oil, but an attack on Karag Island could set back the Iranian oil industry years.  


Also, something that has been strangely quiet is the 
Strait of Hormuz. A total shutdown would be a drastic effort, we could also see harassment of tankers. Something bigger than July of 2019 but not something to the scale of the 1980s Tanker War could emerge in the next couple of months. 

Finally, another interesting equation is Israel and Hezbollah. Recently, Hezbollah said they would attack Israel if the USA attacks Iran again. I wonder if Israel considers striking first again, despite the fact that their prior engagements in Lebanon were inconclusive strategically."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 12:24:21
5	1578474011.0	It will be interesting to see where in the bases the missiles were targeted. Assuming they have guided missiles this could be a situation where they hit parts of the base where they know troops aren’t located.

7	1578492253.0	As of right now (just after 1 AM eastern) it looks like our take so far is that the strikes were probably more symbolic than anything else.

So they did two things. They launched a few outdated missiles, and they launched a massive media campaign spreading misinformation.

37	1578522955.0	"Everyone should [read this article](https://ctc.usma.edu/qassem-soleimani-irans-unique-regional-strategy/) from 2018 on Qassem Soleimani. He was, without a doubt, one of the most powerful people in the Middle East, and is directly responsible for suporting and maintaining an elaborate network of non-state actors that are responsible for the deaths of thousands, including US and allied troops. Some abstracts I highlighted through my reading:

- In recent years, Iran has projected its power across the Middle East, from Lebanon and Syria to Iraq and Yemen. One of the keys to its success has been a unique strategy of blending militant and state power, built in part on the model of Hezbollah in Lebanon. The acknowledged principal architect of this policy is Major General Qassem Soleimani, the long-serving head of Iran’s Quds (“Jerusalem”) Force. Without question, Soleimani is the most powerful general in the Middle East today; he is also one of Iran’s most popular living people, and has been repeatedly touted as a possible presidential candidate
-  More than anyone else, Soleimani has been responsible for the creation of an arc of inﬂuence—which Iran terms its “Axis of Resistance”—extending from the Gulf of Oman through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Today, with Assad’s impending victory in his country’s calamitous civil war, this Iranian alliance has become stable enough that Qassem Soleimani, should he be so minded, could drive his car from Tehran to Lebanon’s border with Israel without being stopped. And, as the Mossad chief Yossi Cohen has pointed out, the same route would be open to truckloads of rockets bound for Iran’s main regional proxy, Hezbollah.
-  Although practically unknown to the U.S. public, Soleimani in fact manages vast swathes of Iranian foreign policy almost single-handedly. For the best part of 20 years, he has enjoyed the unmediated ear of his country’s supreme leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who calls Soleimani, uniquely among all the Islamic Republic’s heroes, “a living martyr of the Revolution.”13 Abroad, he has made himself the conﬁdant of political leaders in Damascus, Beirut, Baghdad, and even Moscow. 
-  The United Nations Security Council sanctions Soleimani for supporting terrorism and selling Iranian weapons overseas.14 The U.S. government brands him a nuclear proliferator, a supporter of terrorism, a human rights abuser, and a leading suspect in the 2011 plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States by bombing a Washington, D.C., restaurant.15 While most Americans and Europeans may never have heard the name Qassem Soleimani, their intelligence services might wish it came up less often. 
-  To damage the U.S. occupation [in Iraq], Soleimani helped Syrian intelligence create pipelines for funneling Sunni jihadis into Iraq. Once there, the jihadis attacked U.S. forces, often using roadside bombs supplied by Soleimani’s Quds Force from factories inside Iran.36 
- Soleimani soon intervened more directly in Iraq, too, sending in Shi`a militias as proxies. Under his leadership, the Quds Force stood up a number of militias for the express purpose of attacking U.S. and allied troops. Collectively, these organizations were responsible for hundreds of coalition deaths. One of them, Asaib Ahl al-Haq (League of the Righteous), claimed more than 6,000 such attacks between its creation in 2006 and the U.S. withdrawal in 2011—an average of more than three per day, every day, for ﬁve years.
- In 2006, at the height of the bloodshed in Iraq, Soleimani took a break from managing Asaib and its sister groups in order to supervise another Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, in its escalating war with Israel.38 During his absence, U.S. commanders in the Green Zone noted a sharp decline in casualties across the country. Upon his return from Lebanon, Soleimani wrote to U.S. commanders, “I hope you have been enjoying the peace and quiet in Baghdad. I’ve been busy in Beirut!”39 
- In early 2008, Soleimani sent General David Petraeus, then the most senior U.S. commander in Iraq, an imperious message: “Dear General Petraeus: You should be aware that I, Qassem Soleimani, control Iran’s policy for Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, and Afghanistan. And indeed, the ambassador in Baghdad is a Quds Force member. The individual who’s going to replace him is a Quds Force member.”
- Following the outbreak of civil war in Syria in 2011, Soleimani ordered some of his Iraqi militias into Syria to defend the Assad regime.50 For the same purpose, he also set up additional Shi`a militant groups; these included a group of Afghans resident in Iran, the Fatemiyoun Division, and a Pakistani outﬁt, the Zeynabiyoun Brigade.
-  Forces under his command were instrumental in many major offensives of the Syrian war, including the recapture of Qusayr from rebels.
-  In 2018, several of the larger militias loyal to Soleimani, including the Badr Organization and Asaib Ahl al-Haq (both of which battled Western troops during the U.S. occupation) formed a political coalition, the Fatah (Victory) Alliance, which won 48 seats in Iraq’s parliament in the May 2018 elections.65 In the political negotiations that followed those elections, Tehran initially identiﬁed Hadi al-Amiri, leader of the Badr Organization and the Fatah Alliance, as one of its preferred candidates for prime minister (the other being former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki).66 Al-Amiri has acknowledged his friendship with and admiration for Soleimani in effusive terms.67 As transport minister in the al-Maliki government from 2010 to 2014, he allegedly permitted supply ﬂights from Iran to Hezbollah to overﬂy Iraqi airspace at Soleimani’s behest.
- In July 2015, despite peremptory U.N. sanctions prohibiting him from travel outside Iran, Soleimani ﬂew to Moscow (reportedly on a commercial ﬂight) for talks with the Russian defense minister and, reportedly, President Putin himself.78 A few weeks later, Soleimani was back in Syria, spearheading a coordinated offensive against rebel and jihadi groups, under cover of a massively stepped-up Russian air campaign. Putin’s intervention turned the tide decisively in Assad’s favor. By December 2016, Soleimani was pictured touring the remains of Aleppo’s historic heart, a few days after his militias, ﬁghting alongside Syrian regulars, retook the city.
- Hezbollah was established in its current form in 1985 with funds and training from Soleimani’s IRGC; its manifesto of that year proclaimed the group’s ultimate allegiance to then-Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.83 Hezbollah has evolved since then. In 2009, the group adopted a new and less stridently Khomeinist manifesto. But Iran remains its principal backer. Hassan Nasrallah, the group’s secretary general, said in June 2016: “Hezbollah’s budget, salaries, expenses, arms and missiles are coming from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Is this clear? This is no one’s business. As long as Iran has money, we have money. Can we be any more frank about that?""
-  Soleimani himself developed a particularly close bond with Imad Mughniyah, the Hezbollah military chief whom Western and Israeli officials identify as the mastermind behind the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, attacks on the U.S. embassies in the Lebanese capital and in Kuwait City, also in 1983, the 1985 hijacking of TWA ﬂight 847 in which a U.S. Navy diver was beaten and murdered, and the bombings of the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994, respectively.
- In Syria, Hezbollah has proved invaluable to its sponsors in Damascus and Tehran. It began by sending military advisors to Soleimani’s other Shi`a militias, but its ﬁghters soon became actively involved in some of the bloodiest ﬁghting, especially near the Lebanese border
- Soleimani has not been slow to demonstrate his gratitude for Hezbollah’s sacriﬁce. He makes a point of visiting the graves and families of the fallen, treating them with the same hushed reverence he shows toward Iranian dead. In January 2015, he was pictured reading the Qur’an alone at the ﬂower-scattered tombs of Hezbollah ﬁghters, including Jihad Mughniyah
-  Hezbollah’s involvement in the Syrian civil war has strengthened the organization. Hezbollah has acquired a range of advanced weaponry, including drones and anti-tank weapons, from Iran.100 The IRGC is reportedly helping the group to develop underground weapons factories inside Lebanon
- Soleimani has a wealth of experience exploiting sectarian tensions, and a presence on the ground, in the form of Hezbollah and IRGC advisors, through which to do so. And the more civilian casualties Saudi bombing creates in Yemen, the more support the Houthis will attract; indeed, the foreign nature of the intervention is a pillar of the Houthis’ recruitment propaganda"	elkxvb	2020-01-08 23:35:55

I honestly would've expected a much more severe reaction from the Iranians, so maybe they're not done yet, perhaps we'll start seeing an uptick in political assassinations from them or another surprise attack? Given that 1) only one base was attacked, 2) no Americans were killed or 3) that the base itself wasn't completely destroyed, I'm guessing they're done.

Despite all the rhetoric from TrumpCo, I don't think anybody here wants to get into an actual shooting war with Iran either, this could just be a case of the Pentagon stupidly giving an irrational option to an irrational person, and then being surprised that they picked that option.

The Afghan papers recently revealed that from the beginning we never had a strategy there. Never knew what to do after wiping out Al'Qaeda. To this day we still don't even know what victory would look like in Afghanistan because we don't know who are the good guys.

There's a story about how Afghanis would set up decoy sites to look like makeshift terrorism camps so that it would attract strikes. After the US would drop multimillion dollar bombs they would salvage the debris for metal scrap. I guess if you're a defense contractor this is a great deal. Why wouldn't you export this business model to other countries.

Anyway, good times. I'm sure Biden will make this all better. After all he's the guy that wanted Iraq invaded five years before the actual invasion. Nothing changes it just gets slightly worse."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 10:16:46

54	1578475874.0	"Considering this is a direct escalation of an act of War the United States committed against a senior member of their military, there's really not much hope of this incident being allowed to pass peacefully with Trump in office. Trump has committed entirely to a hawkish policy that will see the US finally engaging Iran in open warfare. Truth be told, it was likely going to happen anyway with Iran's trend of supporting bad actors throughout the region to further it's agenda, but the optics could have been handled far differently to and the war either pushed off or negated completely by hopefully causing the mullahs government to collapse by popular revolt.

Now, most likely, Trump will authorize retaliatory strikes into Iran. Iran is at full military readiness so it's possible we could see active jet fighter engagements, further US casualties, and generally a spiraling escalation. This will further cement the US public's undecided voters in the middle against Trump in my opinion (and maybe a number of Republicans). I have little doubt anti war protests will manifest shortly.

This incessant badgering of Iran has been basically non stop since the 90's, even the praised Obama Nuclear Deal was in violation of Iran's rights under the NPT. Imagine how much of boom Iran's economy would have if they had been able to shift their entire country to nuclear power in the 2000's like they were planning. Generating their own uranium fuel allowing them to use the bulk of thier oil for export. They'd probably be all driving electric cars and praised internationally as a model for reducing greenhouse gases. 

Certainly the region would be alot more stable.

146	1578475783.0	I’d like to remind everyone who is blaming the President for the missile strikes that killed General Suleimani that they are missing proper context. Within the bowels of the upper echelons of the US Government, national security information passes hands very delicately and under highly classified purviews. We will never know what that information was, from where the information came, or through whom it passed. The President did not wake up and decide to kill someone today. Contrary to media portrayal, President Trump is not a blood thirsty monster. The intel came to him, likely with a recommendation to take action. The strikes could have been planned for hours, days, weeks, or months. The bottom line is that President Trump did not single handedly “assassinate” anyone. It is true that the orders come from him, seeing as he is the Commander in Chief. But he is not the only player here. And we, the average civilians, will never know what led to that missile strike. The information that preceded the order is highly classified and will never be released to the public.	elkxvb	2020-01-08 10:29:43

Tinfoil hat time...

Iran, for whatever reason, tipped US off on the strike because US was agreeing to already leave Iraq, but needed a reason to do so or it looks like we invaded their country and left them high and dry, which we have. Although Suleman appears to be loved internally in Iran, there is internal unrest in Iran to the point where protestors were being gunned down in streets by their own government. Potentially the Iran gov. Wanted him gone, and through back channel communications with US, they gave the green light for his assassination. 

Fast forward to today, Iran says we will tip you off about the missle attacks so you dont lose any soldiers, and we can kill some anti Iran Iraqis in the process, and begin our own expansion into Iraq, i.e.-closer to Syria, meaning they can shore up their security by being closer to any action over there. Iraq is being reshaped daily and is really a weak state at the moment, it could be a land grab for Iran. The leaders in Iran look like they have brass balls standing up to the US, and the US, who needed reason to leave Iraq, now has a legitimate reason to stop having to prop up Iraq after it demolished their society. 

Trump gets credit of assasination, loses no US troops, looks actually reasonable if he doesnt retaliate, but now can bang the war drum for weeks and weeks to distract from impeachment. Losing a Commander in Chief during potentially a war is not something man ""red blooded,"" god fearing, steak eating, pickup driving hick American people will support. Plus the Military Industrial Complex continues to laugh all the way to the bank. Meanwhile our presence in the region is barely affected by leaving Iraq, and in fact gives a reason to make strategic changes and shift to more opportunistic locations in the region.

If some deal comes out of this that would include a nuclear armistice, then both sides will look like geniuses.

317	1578522962.0	"-  Soleimani seems to have realized that having large numbers of jihadis under lock and key could be a strategic asset. Of the four al-Qaida members released during this early period, three held European passports; it is possible they were considered more likely to be able to wreak havoc against Iran’s adversaries in the West.144 By the same logic, around the fall of 2002, the Iranian authorities offered to send certain Saudi al-Qa`ida members for training with Hezbollah, on condition that they would use the training to mount attacks in Saudi Arabia; however, it seems that they all refused this offer
-   In July 2004, Soleimani’s people attempted to make contact with Usama bin Ladin himself in order to request the al-Qaida leader’s intercession to curtail a vicious campaign against Shi`a holy sites in Iraq by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
- As his power grows, he has continued to maintain this unassuming public persona— except, perhaps, when roused by social media needling from the president of the United States. Yet this pious image has not stopped Soleimani from becoming a cult ﬁgure in his own country, as omnipresent on Iranian state television as he is in the Twitter feeds of his Shi`a militias. According to one report, there exist at least 10 Instagram accounts dedicated to burnishing his brand.1
- Nor is Soleimani’s fame limited to personal or official channels. His portrait is revered everywhere from political rallies to bodybuilding contests
- Soleimani’s runaway popularity naturally raises the question of whether he might seek political office—perhaps even the presidency itself. 
- There is, of course, a strong sense in which it doesn’t matter whether Soleimani seeks political office or not. He is already one of the most popular and powerful ﬁgures in Iran, without the need to delve into the cutthroat world of Iranian politics. Rouhani’s fate, and that of Ahmadinejad before him (also brought low by an economic crisis), would seem to conﬁrm that the presidency can be a poisoned chalice, especially in hard times. So why choose to drink from it? The more likely future seems to be one that continues the current trajectory, in which Soleimani continues to grow his military and diplomatic empire in the shadows
- Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” has been built on the efforts of proxies controlled by Soleimani in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen—and on the marriage between state and militant power that Iran has been able to broker in each of those countries. The success of this model will have repercussions across the Middle East for years, if not decades to come."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 23:36:02

2. Soleimani was most popular in the middle east for his role in purging ISIS and other terrorists from Iraq and Syria.

3. Muhandis (the Iraqi official that died in the same bombing in Baghdad) was involved in nearly every major battle in Iraq against ISIS.

4. Soleimani was by far the most popular political figure in Iran with 8/10 Iranians viewing him favorably because he was seen as a fighter AGAINST extremism in the middle east.

5. All of the terrorists in the middle east follow salafist wahabbist ideology that Saudi Arabia is responsible for exporting and funding and Soleimani spent his entire career fighting against them."	elkxvb	2020-01-09 00:36:27

Trump was offered killing Soleimani as an extreme response to only make the other responses sound more reasonable. Iraqi allies have already said that the US had no evidence to implicate Soleimani for that attack and obviously did so to dramatically escalate tension in the Iran/Iraqi region. Bush and Obama both had the capability and means to kill Soleimani but both saw that as too extreme of an option considering that we’re not in a full blown war with Iran and killing a political leader of sovereign country could be viewed as a baseless assassination that would only lead to escalation. 

There’s never been a more definitive case to link a president to the being solely responsible for escalating hostility in the region to do unilateral policy than with Trump and Iran. Trump tore up the Iran Deal (let’s face it, only because it was Obama’s deal) and imposed a “maximum pressure” economic strategy in Iran in the form of sanctions to try and starve the people and force regime change. Iran’s incentive for adhering to the Iran Deal was the easing of economic sanctions so Trump unilateral move to withdraw us from a multinational deal as well as increase anti-iranian rhetoric and force harsh economic sanctions put Iran in a place where they’re only options were to blockade ships in the straight of Hormuz to be taken seriously as a sovereign  nation. Trump’s Iranian strategy can only be summarized as an utter failure because he only succeeded in accomplishing the polar opposite of what he set out to do in Iran. Only two months ago, Iranian people were protesting their government and now they’re protesting the American government. By Trump saying he would target cultural sites shows that his problem with the Iranian people ideologically and no longer with the regime.

War has a way of accelerating itself. That was clear lesson of the first world war, which we seem to have forgotten. It's the same factor that kept us in Vietnam long past the point we should have left: once there's enough blood in the water, neither nation can back down. Neither nation can accept anything except total victory. 

How many American troops does Iran have to kill before the US politically can't withdraw? Even if Trump massively loses reelection, a president Biden or president Sanders can't just withdraw from an in-progress, all-out war against a major power. 

If both sides step back from the brink now, it may be possible to prevent any further escalation. Or, depending on the level of damage, we may have already passed that point. If Iran just killed a hundred US service members, we're stuck there. The US will be forced to respond in kind. Then Iran will have to retaliate with a larger response. Etc. Pretty soon you have carrier groups getting targeted. Even if Trump is defeated, what do you think the odds of us leaving are if they manage to say, sink a carrier? If the US kills a hundred thousand Iranians in various air strikes, do you think the Iranian leaders will be able to back down before achieving anything less than completely driving the US out of the region?

That said, the maybe majority saw him as a leader in the government they support. Further, he was instrumental in leading Iran allied troops against ISIS as well as fending off Saudi expansionism in the region.

Iran complied with the deal over a year after Trump tore it up and it wasn’t until we gave them no other alternative did they decide to actually protest Trump’s unfettered aggression. A blind man could see that Trump hated the Iran Deal because it was a first of its kind multinational diplomatic achievement accomplished by Barrack Obama, Iran’s not stupid and they knew that Trump was essentially using his aggression towards them to undermine the achievements made by the previous administration. By the way, the storming of that embassy (which lead to not a single person being injured or security being breached) is by no way linked to Soleimani, and from what gathered from our Iraqi allies, it was due to the airstrike in Kirkuk that killed 30 of the same serviceman that helped us fight against ISIS. The people that attacked that embassy were Iraqis, not Iranians and the only reason Pompeo offered killing Soleimani in response was to make his alternative responses seem more calculated. 

Even if Soleimani himself was there storming the embassy in Iraq, how does assassinating him (a political figurehead with an 82% approval rating) prevent Iran from wanting to carrying out more attacks? If Iran decided to assassinate Mike Pompeo, would that prevent/dissuade us from retaliating? 

The US had been fighting a proxy war with Iran for 16 before Iran Nuclear Deal was signed and after that we literally had zero military aggression from Iran. We achieved diplomatic peace that presented the best outcome for both sides and Trump destroyed it because he hates Obama and wants to destroy his legacy. Trump’s advisors, the pentagon, and our allies abroad (including Israel and the Saudis) cautioned us against leaving the Deal and Trump did it anyway. That is the one event that we can point to identify as the catalyst for all of these subsequent events that have taken place.

796	1578540011.0	The reason this was “out of nowhere” is because this was neither calculated, nor planned. You can do some research and see that killing Soleimani was weighed by both Bush and Obama but they ultimately concluded that it was lead to escalating to war in the middle east. The only reason that Trump decided to kill him is because Pompeo and the SOD flew to Mar-A-Lago to offer Trump a menu of responses for the Iraqis storming the embassy and firing rockets at it... This might sound strange but storming and even firing at our embassies in the middle east by our regional enemies is not uncommon at all. The sole reason that assassinating Soleimani was offered by Pompeo and co. was to make the alternative responses seem more reasonable. Soleimani didn’t order the attack on the embassy, the embassy was being protested (by Iraqis) because of our airstrike in Kirkuk that killed 30 Iraqi servicemen. These are the same people that aided in our fight against ISIL. Trump however had been watching cable news and saw the protesting of the embassy and was pissed so his he unilaterally ordered the most extreme response possible.	elkxvb	2020-01-09 04:20:11

IMO they overextended by attacking an embassy, the US used that as justification to kill a highly coveted target, and Iran was limited to responding with impotent theatrics. It seems to me pretty clear that Iran lost big in this exchange.

I have the perception that President Regan would want to de-escalate the situation, if only because Iran wasn’t friendly with the USSR at that point. The US engaging in military action against them would likely push them closer to the Soviets, which is bad. 

Conversely, President Trump doesn’t have a similar policy and even if there is an Anti-Russian policy, Iran has been pretty close with Moscow the last 25ish years. What he does have is a reputation for overreacting, and a built image with his base that he is strong and will protect American lives and assets AND put America first. It’s easy to look in the short term and see how a Pax Romana style of policy would resonate with that message even if it leads to long term problems for the US.

Im not saying Iran doesnt have plenty of bad people doing bad things.  I, like most Americans that agree with me, have no clue what we could possibly gain going to war with Iran.  What end would we be going for?  That if we kill enough Iranians and destroy enough of their cities they'll thank us and be good guys?

Something rapid and unexpected must have happened because the pilots didn't have time or couldn't contact air traffic control. Pilots of the aircraft were also experienced which decreases the probability of human error. The fact that the plane's transponder stopped recording altitude after reaching 8km suggests the plane had a catastrophic, sudden emergency, otherwise the transponder would have recorded plunging altitude.	elkxvb	2020-01-09 00:39:35

Iran's regional presence is one of its main assets of deterrence and they are not ready to let it go easily. That assassination was not just an act of tit for tat. It was to cripple Iran's ability to reach beyond its borders and then continue to take out Iran's assets one by one.

No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives, and it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the “Brexit” states.

He'd been spending so much time around the heartland of America, talking to many different people, interviewing for his movie Trumpland. And this clip (though deceitfully edited, I'll get to that later) encompasses a good solid portion of why people voted for Trump. It was shared like wildfire across the conservative circles I knew.

But it was also deceptive, because it cut the whole second half of the speech out. [The one that told of what would happen after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVLTQIUMq18&feature=youtu.be).

The NYT speculated that if the US pulled out of Iraq, then Iran (and Russia) would stand to benefit the most.

Every country understands that the oil is desirable in Iraq.  There's about 27 trillion dollars in oil there.

Part of me wonders if Trump's firing of that missile might have been an *orchestrated misstep*.  Because at a later date, if he actually does decide to pull out of Iraq even a bit, he would have earned public approval, and it would appease some of the *interesting partners* he's been pandering to as of late.  He'd be practically *handing what's been pillaged from Iraq, to Iran and Russia on a silver platter!*

This is just a theory, but a curious one at that.  The alternative is that either Trump, or the US, or some other country like Russia/China/Iran would have to have something to gain with the introduction of such a silly war... and I doubt the US would go to war with Iran due to their current political ties with Russia.

It all seems like a horrifying catch 22.  Damned if the US leaves Iraq because they'd be gifting part of the 27 trillion in oil to a foreign power, which they spent over 1 trillion on.  Damned if the US fights back, because they'd be in another war.  But its allies are already pulling out... so the pieces are already moving.

The only winning move here seems to be to fortify in place and show restraint; which sounds silly, because the US performed an act of aggression in war without any bone in that fight.  But there doesn't seem to be an alternative that isn't morally worse :/

Oh, except guys like Bush, Cheney, oil executives, etc.  Sensible people aren’t “taking sides” when they say they don’t want a war somewhere where people don’t even want us around.  The guy was a bad dude, the world is full of them.  But no impeached president - Clinton included - should be making such drastic decisions.

Americans don't want another war and thousand more dead Americans in a war that no one wanted. It was uncalled for because America was not under threat for this to have happened.

I highly doubt as crappy as Iran's missiles are that firing multiple ballistic cruise missiles would miss and cause 0 damage...it just doesnt add up.

Russia is a paper tiger militarily. They have a much weaker armed forces than the Soviet Union had at its collapse.

Strategic/strategically is used when you’re referring to the overall goals at a command level. Think in terms of strategic bombing campaigns to shut down power/water, disrupt high speed avenues of ingress/egress, and neutralizing key infrastructure such as radar installations, and fuel/ammunition depots, refineries/factories.

I’m definitely not trying to be a jerk, in the coming days/weeks I hope this information might help you to better understand exactly what’s being discussed, and what certain terminology means when used by military leaders.

Their oil lines and refineries would be gone within the first hour of shooting. Ammunition storage and bunkers gone shortly before that. 

Iran's capacity to fight, comprised nearly entirely of decades old Soviet and Chinese equipment, would be completely neutralized by the US Air Force and Navy in such rapid fashion, Iran would not be able to begin mounting retaliation.

We've been bullying them ever since and the people saying that the Iran deal was a farce, need to credibly explain how the situation we're in now, is better than it was under Obama. The money we gave them was money from their accounts that we froze, they got it back with interest BUT they had to submit to our rules and random inspections. They passed every single inspection and some sites are under 24 hour surveillance.

    Now Soleimani was definitely not a good guy but we were allied with him to fight ISIS. He did alot to take them out of Iraq and he did  try to repel the 03 invasion  (which was an illegal offensive war against a nation who didn't attack us). That being said, a good GENERAL rule whenever an American base is attacked is ""it wasn't the Shia's"" because they just don't do that. Even after we killed their general, Hezbollah and the Iranian government said ""we won't kill American civilians because they did nothing wrong "" while Trump threatened war crimes on Twitter. There was rocket attack at a US base where ""one American contractor"" was killed, allegedly. Again, we were just trusting Shia militias enough to give them power over US air strikes but in response to the rocket attacks they kill 25 Shia militants. Iraqi people are upsst about drone strikes in their country so they protest and trump blamed it on Soleimani? That's horse shit and it's horse shit that there was an ""imminent attack"" planned.

Additionally, Kim Jong Un's authoritarian regime prevents citizens from leaving the country while also heavily censoring access to the internet. North Korea has been violating its constituents' rights while world leaders turn their heads' away.

The question shouldn't be how many ""innocents"" are you willing to sacrifice; lives are already being lost on a massive scale, and they have been for a long time. Why should the members of the United Nations, wealthy nations like the United States, look away while innocent North Koreans' are losing their lives.

Plus, if he really is the idiot people claim that he is then we have nothing but our own culture and national community to blame for putting him in office.

1658	1578480057.0	"Sure there is. They may not involve the great powers, but there are absolutely two major webs of alliances here. On one side you have the US, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Israel, etc. On the other you have Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and likely the Iraqi government and others. And there are other neighboring powers of note that could also get drug into a large conflict, namely Turkey, Pakistan, and god forbid, Russia. 

Will this result in a major war of survival between major nuclear powers? No. But this could absolutely escalate into a conflict that ultimately produces as many military casualties as WW2. Iran is one of the few theaters that could actually result in a true, large scale conventional conflict with huge conventional casualties on both sides. 

Iran is just the ""right"" size, as a power, to cause this. If Iran had nukes, then both sides couldn't get in a large conventional war without nukes being used. If Iran were much smaller, then the US could just roll over them in a conventional war. Iran lacks nukes and has no chance of ever actually invading US territory, thus the US can never justify using nukes against it. The US is stuck with conventional war in any conflict against Iran.

Can Iran ever directly invade or defeat the US? Of course not. But the Confederacy never really stood a chance of completely defeating and occupying the North. Total victory for Iran means driving the US out of the Middle East. Total victory for the US means completely invading and occupying Iranian territory and toppling the Iranian government. The US has a lot more resources and a lot more conventional warfare abilities, but they also have to do much, much more in any conflict. It's the same dynamic as the North vs South in the US Civil War. The Confederacy had half the population and a third of the industry as the North, but they didn't need parity to achieve what they considered victory."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 11:40:57

1677	1578532988.0	"It’s because Iran was getting increasingly emboldened. The Ayatollah openly said to the *United States* that we “cant do anything” after they orchestrated that unrest at our embassy. 

Combined with more and more escalation, Suleimani getting more and more aggressive with his paramilitary groups fighting US aligned forces, shooting down drones, making threats, acting like we can’t touch them, saying we can’t touch them. Increasing their puppeteering of the Iraqi government, executing protestors in both Iran and Iraq, basically making their own little Shia caliphate over there and spreading. 

That kind of attitude is dangerous. By casually assassinating the most beloved military figure in Iran with the press of a button in an air conditioned office, we sent a clear message that we can in fact do something. The idea was to kill Suleimani before he did something bad enough to make Americans want war. Even a truck bomb by a random Shia militia killing a dozen troops could spark a full scale conflict. 

This is what the administration/pentagon claim from what I understand. I’m playing devils advocate here, I definitely DO NOT trust the Pentagon on these matters but at the same time I do accept the argument that Iran was getting bolder and bolder, less and less afraid of something they really need to be afraid of."	elkxvb	2020-01-09 02:23:08

He worked hard to ensure Hillary was not elected because she would have 1. seen through his bull and 2. stood up to him instead of kissing his assets the way Trump has. This is all part of a multi-facted effort to isolate and destabilize the US, and Trump is neither seeing nor reacting appropriately to the obvious threat.

When the Pentagon noted after his death that Soleimani “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq” it was easy to believe. He’d already done it.

The problem is that our strategic objective in the Middle East isn’t to kill people with impunity—we have a whole bunch of complex and interdependent goals in the region, like wanting Iraq to remain stable and wanting to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

They were mostly linked to the funeral parades being held for the Iraqis killed by US strikes prior. Which Iraqi PM called ""A stab in the back"" and condemned the United States for carrying them out. 

White House of course linked the protesters directly to Iran. That is their narrative and always will be. It's like people have never heard of the old ""Weapons of mass destruction"" strategy. Can't believe people are stupid enough to fall for it again to justify war."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 23:28:31

The U.S. has blamed the Iran-supported group for a series of rocket attacks aimed at coalition bases in Iraq.

So to follow this: 

* A group, [Kata'ib Hezbollah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata%27ib_Hezbollah), founded in 2003 and has been involved in Iraq insurgency and resistance against US occupation for nearly two decades is thought to be responsible for [a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that kills one US contractor.](https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/american-defense-contractor-killed-troops-wounded-in-rocket-attack-on-base-in-kirkuk-1.612677)

* Iraqi citizens attack the US embassy in protest of the airstrikes, they do not breach the embassy. [They burned 
 and damaged a guard shack and reception area in the larger compound outside the embassy.](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/01/02/photos-reveal-damage-to-us-embassy-in-baghdad-following-attack-by-supporters-of-iran-backed-militia/)
US Marines observed the protesters but did not engage. [The protesters eventually complied with calls to withdraw.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-usa-idUSKBN1Z01N9)
[The Embassy was never evacuated and no one was injured](https://apnews.com/75228a8a607a44863b57021ac33264dc)

* US response was to [assassinate Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani](https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2020-01-03/was-the-drone-attack-on-iranian-general-an-assassination).

* Iran responds with [missile attack on Iraqi bases housing US troops](https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/us-iran-soleimani-tensions-intl-01-07-20/index.html)

If you've made it this far and looked at all the known facts you'll see that the US has taken any incident and directed the blame directly at Iran. The protest outside the embassy were done by citizens, not a militia group. US military and Iraqi military personnel observed the ongoing protest and did not warrant any violence to disperse the protesters. The protesters eventually left on their own after failing to breach the compound and injuring NO ONE. 

Linking the protest to justification of killing Soleimani is a huge leap and obviously no way is it a justification for the assassination. The conservative media and White House would love for your to believe this is a measured response however."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 22:37:02

You are definitly right about that the US should not start a war, and that trump perhaps made a huge mistake. But you can't admire suleimani. He has killed tousands of innocents, in both Iraq and Syria (he aided the Assad regime, and he basicly owned the iraqi regime) He was a piece of shit.

Did the US Win Iraq? Yes. At what cost? 

The financial and political cost is absolutely unprecedented.  
Latest estimates are the Iraq war cost 2.4 trillion and the outcome took months and months.  
But that is not at all what I'm talking about, turn on Al Jazeera right now and there are several analyst interviews on their news cycle discussing Irans assymetric warfare in the region is absolutely beyond any other nation, while the US is fighting a ground war Iran is fighting a guerilla campaign that will kill thousands.  
Its just absurd to think this would be two armies finding each other in a field and one comes out the victor, that is not how modern warfare happens.

Iran's Air Defense is fairly up to date and sophisticated, flying air sorties over a densely defended nation is going to mean many air casualties.  
Unless you go in unsupported by ground forces to target the defense installations.   
Or you spend a couple billion in ordinance to target them at range.  
But its going to take time and man power, while that is happening you've declared war on a billion people who have a history of extremism and will be coming at you from all sides.

After so many years of wars against nations people thought the US would just spend two weeks beating up on while they've lost thousands upon thousands of people, it blows my mind that people look at Iran and think ""that'll be easy""."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 15:04:56

Nothing?
There were no US Troops harmed in the embassy protests.
There are slot of reasons why the world has condemned this.
For one of the most decorated heroes in the fight against ISIS and someone who was a US ally was killed on the attack as well.
Second this was a government official who was put in place by a sovereign nation, attacking and killing terrorist leaders is one thing but this was the assassination of a person put in power by a sovereign nation and the US just unilaterally without trial or justice killed him and others without warning.
Now, why is this happening? Why is Iran in the grip of a government and ruler who would allow a man like that to operate within their scope? 
Because in 1953 Elements of the CIA sparked and lead a revolution in Iran so as to overthrow the democratically ELECTED government in favour of a more religious extremist leadership who, they thought, would be more US Friendly.
Now imagine the US is a poorer country and Iran is a super power and for the last 30 years Mexico, Canada and the US itself has been occupied by a superior force who kills indiscriminately, John McCain was just killed without warning or trial while visiting his family and the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was with him and died from the same attack.

Edit: source. Feel free to disagree, but please do your own research as well.

[Here's the first google search result I got.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/why-kill-soleimani-now/604441/) According to AllSides.com, The Atlantic leans left politically, FWIW. 

From the article: 
> Just about nobody in Washington wants to defend Qassem Soleimani—even if they condemn his killing. He was a terrorist kingpin; he destroyed the lives of countless people across an entire region for more than a decade; he had Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Lebanese, and American blood on his hands. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy slammed what he called an assassination as he tweeted, “Soleimani was an enemy of the United States. That’s not a question.” Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chair of House Foreign Affairs Committee, decried the lack of consultation with Congress; he also called Soleimani “the mastermind of immense violence, suffering, and instability.” Much of the litany of Soleimani’s crimes through two presidential administrations prior to Donald Trump’s is well-known.

>So why kill him now?

>George W. Bush did not target him during the height of the Iraq War, when Iranian-supplied roadside bombs and Iran-backed militias were killing hundreds of American troops. By 2011, that toll had reached more than 600 and Barack Obama was the president; he too declined to hit the general. But at some point Trump, who came into office vowing to pull the United States out from Middle Eastern wars, decided to cross a line two war-president predecessors feared breaching."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 21:45:30
2003	1578542275.0	"Like I said, if we really wanted him dead, we should have pushed Iran to revoke his status in their country. If they did, he would either have gone into hiding or continued his actions against western forces, in which case we would have had every right to target him. If they didn't, we could have escalated from there, even threatening or declaring actual war for them allowing someone who was taking military action against us to remain as a member of their government.

We are fighting a whole lot of people in the middle east, and are at war with various organizations there as we have been for decades now, but we are not at war with Iran or any other nation for that matter. That isn't just red tape. In fact it means we regularly receive aid in various forms from the governments in the region in order to fight those organizations. There is a big difference between fighting various terrorist organisations throughout the region and committing to a war against a country and it's military.

 Frankly, even if we were at war with Iran, the way this was done would have been unacceptable. We assassinated a foreign official who was on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace, in a nation we are currently allied with, thus violating their sovereignty in the process. 

Enemy or not, war or not, our nation was very clearly in the wrong in this situation."	elkxvb	2020-01-09 04:57:55

We can't just assassinate foreign leaders because they're bad people. The world would be utter chaos if that was an okay thing for nations to do.

When there's a problem with a foreign official, you deal with their government to bring that person under control or at least get them to stop doing whatever they're doing that you have a problem with. If it gets to the point that you literally see no solution other than killing them, that is literally the point of declaring war. There were more steps to take here if we wanted solemani out of the Iranian government.

Also, if the reporting is true that the US was able to track in real-time the missile trajectories and evacuate the targeted areas, and that's why there were no casualties from the strikes, doesn't that pretty strongly dampen the threat from Iran if America can just share intel with its allies to prevent casualties?	elkxvb	2020-01-09 01:00:02

The United States' main fighting weapons were designed in a different era, where large, expensive machines made sense. Iran has had many years to watch and adapt its own military. What do you think will win today: an aircraft carrier and its F35s, or a cloud of drones with explosives strapped on? The USA is locked into having these huge, expensive targets, because that's where money went. You cannot innovate and improve a carrier as fast as you can a small drone.  

This is personal conjecture, I have no links for it.

2118	1578518728.0	Stating there were no US casualties WAS the deescalation.  We have no idea if there were or weren’t, and the prospect of a very long war with the Islamic world hangs on the statement of whether American soldiers were just killed.  If the public statement is that the US just lost soldiers on an airstrike on our base, then with Iran, and this administration, this president will 100% certainly respond with immediate & total commitment to another gigantic endless war.  The provocation of murdering Iran’s General out of the blue was just effective enough to goad Iran into action, but it’s really too early and quick.  Our branches really prefer 3-6 months of public build-up, to increase recruitment and spend ample time training and preparing properly.  Rushing into battle gets worse the bigger the war, and war against Iran is an exponentially more difficult and longer endeavor than Iraq.  Even if there were casualties, admitting them now publicly, and presenting them to this president to respond to also publicly, it‘s terribly inopportune timing.  This isn’t some minor conflict, and after the last 15 years, our military really prefers to have a more stable basis for major wars, with more time to prepare for the specifics at hand and secure more control of the theatre going in.  Not declaring any casualties leaves everything open.	elkxvb	2020-01-08 22:25:28

Only way to find out is to have the war, and I certainly hope that doesn't happen.

What we *do* know is that Trump *thinks* starting a war with Iran would get him reelected. We know this because he tweeted in 2011 that Obama would do just that. Trump's brain isn't complicated enough to form mental model's of other people's minds; anything he attributes to another person is just projection.

You will find that they adhered to the agreement long after we pulled out. There were disagreements about UN Security Council Resolution 2231, because Iran still wanted ballistic missiles for defense and disagreed they could carry a nuclear payload. Also, there were a few times when they were slightly over the heavy water limit, but complied immediately and shipped it out.

You are being flip when you say, ""we don't owe them anything"". We did give our word, and then backed out. Also, do they really owe us anything? No. But, it's called diplomacy. It rarely works unless each side gets something, but nobody leaves with everything they want.

it doesnt matter which president did what exactly.  to the rest of the world, the us is an arrogant country that has been doing this shit for decades, interfering in foreign politics as they please, not hesitating to kill thousands of civillians or their own men if they have a political or economic advantage to gain by doing so.

He was the founder and leader of Al Qaeda; a group that not only held ties to 9/11, but claimed responsibility for the attack. Fighting proxy wars has never been a justification to launch an attack on an official from a sovereign nation; i.e. the reason why the Cold War didn’t explode. If a nation or its officials should be attacked on the basis of waging proxy wars; then the US would probably be a small island.	elkxvb	2020-01-08 23:19:52

People like you always act like you have the moral high ground because you want to act like kids on a playground.  ""He spat on my toys so I burned his, so he broke mine so I blew his up"".  You can talk all you want about how we're ""just responding"" to attacks.  The facts are 

1) both sides would say the other started it and both could be right, you don't just keep going tit for tat until legitimate war breaks out and say that's just how it is. 

 2) We've chosen which attacks apparently matter in the past to go to war when its financially beneficial to those at the top and which didnt matter because it wasn't.  Saudi Arabia committed the number one instance of aggression on America that any living being can point to as a point go anger for for Americans but theyre a cornerstone of the US global market so we ignored them.  Even better though is we did want to use it as a reason to go to war so our leaders made up complete lies and fabrications about Iraq and everyone gobbled that shit up and loom where it got us.

He was sent at the behest of his government into a foreign nation to conduct military and terrorist operations. When you go to war, there is a risk that you will be killed. The Iranian government and this general took that risk and he was killed. Now they're upset because a soldier who went to conduct warfare in a foreign country is dead. This would be a very different thing if we did it while this general was in Iran. But this man was in Iraq, and he had recently conducted an attack on one of our embassies. He has led operations that have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Americans and Lord knows how many civilians in the Middle East. 

I have noticed a distinct lack of a negative reaction from our primary rivals (Russua, China, NPRK). The countries that take every possible chance to demean, humiliate, and cast a negative light on us have mysteriously stayed silent about this.  The only people that are saying this is bad are people that don't like President Trump. Tell me honestly that if President Obama had conducted this exact attack in this exact manner on this exact person, that we would not be saying ""Good job"". Of course I think that's a moot point.

Bizarre. You should have your noggin examined. 

They have been hiding weapons and POWs and soldiers in mosques since the 80s since they knew we wouldn’t mess with one. If they really cared about their cultural sites they wouldn’t do that. And they wouldn’t have flown the red flag of war over a MOSQUE 2 days ago."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 18:22:34

The reality is that action was needed. The guy was a terrorist (a handsome one, but still a terrorist); the guy riding shotgun was a terrorist, too; and they were right there, in plain sight, and presented a great opportunity for a drone to make the world a better place.

Iran responded with Operation Martyr Soleimani, 22 missiles aimed at the bases where the attack against Soleimani came from. Nobody was hurt by the attacks, but there was a good amount of property damage. Iran informed the Iraqi government and Finnish and Lithuanian militaries beforehand, as if they expected one of those to inform the US, so we wouldn't have anyone there.

Soleimani was no saint but neither were Patreus who engineered the COIN doctrine of night time house raids where thousands of Iraqis disappeared in the middle of the night to be tortured and raped in various black sites in Iraq, “Mad Dog” Mattis who orchestrated and oversaw the massacre of Fallujah in 2004 (while proudly claiming that “shooting people is fun”), or Col. Steele who created, organized, and coordinated Shi’a-backed Iraqi death squads that ran amuck in Iraq causing chaos and terror throughout 2005 to 2008.

The actions of all of these U.S. generals and higher ups were the precursor for the rise of ISIS which Soleimani is mostly responsible for curtailing their advance in Iraq and Syria. I guess the precedent that anyone who worked against the interest of the U.S. is now a “bad guy” or “terrorist” speaks volumes of the mentality of the average American.

It’s pathetic that people now think it’s okay that one person can act as judge, jury, and executioner without any oversight and not think it’s a problem.

And to think these types of drone assassinations would never be used on American citizens is incredibly childish and naive as Anwar al-Alawki and his 16 year old American-born son were killed in the same manner a few years back. Whatever disgusting barbaric acts exported on foreign lands are always brought back on domestic soil (the militarization of local police forces is the perfect example of the model of policing implemented in Iraq that was imported back in the US).

There was just a guy on CNN that had seen the actual damage (almost none) and had pictures of the missiles themselves. It was completely obvious that there was almost no damage and zero casualties. 

I was more refuting the false equivalency between the widespread lies and propaganda of a totalitarian regime and a first world country with a free press.

You can claim it is their right all you want - but then you are just an Iran apologetic.

It is perfectly possible to have a civil nuclear program, plenty of states do, but Iran are refusing to follow the steps layed out by the rest of the world to accept this.

And No, the US are not giving the Saudis nuclear weapon technology.  They are cooperating on civil nuclear. Much like South Korea has done with UAE. Again, without enrichment (or fuel reprocessing) capabilities, this is not an issue.

From the article: 
> Just about nobody in Washington wants to defend Qassem Soleimani—even if they condemn his killing. He was a terrorist kingpin; he destroyed the lives of countless people across an entire region for more than a decade; he had Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Lebanese, and American blood on his hands. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy slammed what he called an assassination as he tweeted, “Soleimani was an enemy of the United States. That’s not a question.” Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chair of House Foreign Affairs Committee, decried the lack of consultation with Congress; he also called Soleimani “the mastermind of immense violence, suffering, and instability.” Much of the litany of Soleimani’s crimes through two presidential administrations prior to Donald Trump’s is well-known.

>So why kill him now?

>George W. Bush did not target him during the height of the Iraq War, when Iranian-supplied roadside bombs and Iran-backed militias were killing hundreds of American troops. By 2011, that toll had reached more than 600 and Barack Obama was the president; he too declined to hit the general. But at some point Trump, who came into office vowing to pull the United States out from Middle Eastern wars, decided to cross a line two war-president predecessors feared breaching."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 22:44:23
2710	1578552862.0	"The truth is that we don't know that he actually killed any Americans. He almost certainly was responsible for some of the American deaths in Iraq over the last few years, albeit indirectly. Frankly, it's quite a complicated situation.

Originally, he actually aided us in trying to dismantle the Taliban and only stopped when Bush publicly announced that Iran was our enemy, or part of the new axis of evil or whatever he said. Even after that he was not in conflict with us, just stopped supporting us.

He then aided Hezbollah in their war with Israel, then aided the Syrian government in their civil war, both of which meant fighting against our allies, though not necessarily our troops as we had no boots on the ground in the former and very, very few in the latter as we offered more aid, logistical support, weapons deals, and occasionally tactical bombings or drone strikes in those fights, not soldiers on the ground. Like us, Iran was a supporting force in those wars, not the main force, so we weren't in direct conflict, and likely inflicted very few, if any, casualties to each other. Despite no real fighting between us at that time, them fighting against our allies obviously increased tensions.

He more recently aided our allies in the Iraqi civil war against ISIS, and was probably instrumental in their defeat. At the very least he was instrumental in pushing them out of several important Iraqi cities. Despite fighting a common foe, we still weren't on friendly terms due to our previous conflicts and the general animosity between our countries. I don't believe we actually had any sort of armed conflict at the time, though, as we were both focused on getting ISIS out of Iraq. 

We have since fought against the many small militant groups that were left after the war as they vie for power or simply want to push us out of the region, including ones that we were allied with during the war with ISIS. The pentagon has reported that about 600 of our casualties in Iraq are attributed to groups that were funded by Iran. He is probably responsible for getting the aid for at least some of those groups, but it's extremely, extremely unlikely he actually commanded any of them. This is the only thing I can find where he may have killed Americans, but as I said, indirectly. In fact, we also funded many of those groups, Hezbollah included, ourselves until they decided to attack us. Russia funds many as well. As do many other nations. They've got to be getting money and weapons from somewhere after all. These are what we call proxy wars. We don't directly attack the countries that do this as it has become an accepted tactic over the past several decades as a way to fight for our interests with other nations, or even just hinder nations we don't like, without directly attacking each other. When it's discovered that a country has done this, we denounce them for it, sometimes sanctioning them for it as well. They do the same to us when they find out we've been doing it. Even if he were involved in all that and we could prove it, it was not used as justification for his assassination. Such a thing has never been used as a justification for an attack against any foreign diplomat by any nation because so many of us do it, and none of us want to start that precedent as it could quite quickly lead to an actual war between nations rather than these relatively small proxy wars that usually lead to relatively few casualties.

What led to his assassination is that he was close with the leadership of Hezbollah, given they've worked together with the force he commands (the Qud's) for many years. Recently there was an attack on a US base that we believe Hezbollah was responsible for (though they denied responsibility and any evidence is still classified). That attack had one casualty and I think 20 wounded. We retaliated with a strike of our own against Hezbollah, killing 20-something and wounding more. Then, there was the recent attack on our embassy in Iraq which was perpetrated by Hezbollah-supporting Iranians. We believe it was orchestrated by Hezbollah, possibly with Soleimani's help, as retaliation for our retaliation. It resulted in no casualties or injuries, only property damage, and only on the outside of the embassy as they never made it to the main embassy grounds since it is heavily guarded and they were rioters, not a fighting force. The assassination was a direct retaliation for the embassy attack, as well as prevention of an attack that they were apparently planning, though evidence of that is classified and our congressmen who have commented on it seem unconvinced at it's validity, or at least not convinced it warranted such an extreme reaction. If any have spoken out in defense or in support of the assassination, I have not found it.

We have fought on opposite sides in various conflicts and the same side in others. International relationships are complicated, but we are no more at war with Iran than we are with Russia or China. We fight, mostly via proxies, and we sanction each other but we don't attack each other directly. Honestly, we can tie more American deaths to Saudi Arabia than Iran and they are our allies.

TL;DR he wasn't assassinated because he was killing Americans. He was assassinated because we think he helped organize the embassy attack (which was really just a very small riot that led to no death or injury) and we supposedly have evidence that he was going to kill Americans, though that evidence is unknown and the few people who have seen it and spoken out about it seem skeptical at best."	elkxvb	2020-01-09 07:54:22

The Trump administration interprets the two AUMFs as permitting military action against Iran if it is “necessary to defend U.S. or partner forces engaged in counterterrorism operations or operations to establish a stable, democratic Iraq.” (this information is from Slate.)
International law is not determined by what US admin insists, although international law is generally only upheld when the US agrees since we have the largest military and most power. The United Nations official in charge of examining targeted killings questioned the assassination, noting that the U.S. did not detail any specific plot involving Soleimani.

2962	1578492275.0	You may be right about it being Iraqis. However, assuming that the strike against Soleimani was a direct retaliation for this one event, would be a ludicrous idea. This guy was directly responsible for hundreds of American deaths, as well as thousands of others even within his own country. Iran has been aggressive to the U.S. for some time now. And instead of ignoring it, or making empty threats, decisive and necessary action was taken. I would not say I'm a supporter of this war. But when you show a willingness to attack the U.S. you run the risk of retaliation. I fear that under a different watch, the riot may have been another Benghazi with much more violent implications.	elkxvb	2020-01-08 15:04:35

So you want them to take him out while he’s in Iran, because that’s what you’d be suggesting with Bush or Obama pushing to take him out. He was in Iraq, with a general for kata’ib. As well as being a recent threat with escalating attacks from a group he runs/backs.

> now his death is usefull to distract the world from trumps impeachment process, and give him some momentum in the upcoming election, so they did it.

Ah now the conspiracies come out lmao. I don’t like trump and am not voting for him, but damn thinking he’d put in motion and pull all of the strings it takes to set off a drone strike just to ‘divert attention’ away from impeachment is far fetched.

Things aren’t black and white in this world, sometimes there are necessary evils. Sometimes some people are better off alive than they are dead because our strategic interests align and killing them presents unfavorable outcomes. The enemy of the enemy is my friend, and Soleimani’s crusade against the Daesh and Al Qaeda played into our own pursuits against islamic jihad. Assassinating a political leader doesn’t deter a country from a escalating hostility against you, it only escalates hostility. Soleimani’s nickname in Iran, the general of hearts, he was symbolically viewed as a enigmatic sign of Iran’s national sovereignty. He was also well respected even by countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump learned Soleimani’s name on the morning of the attack. Like I said earlier in this thread, the only reason Pompeo offered the response to the embassy attack as a possible options was to make alternative responses seem more calculated.

""

This depends on the type of radar system and its intended application. You can find a nice bit of history on it here. The early radars could not tell the difference between aircraft types, any kind of movement was coordinated beforehand on the friendly side and anything that was not pre-arranged was considered foe. The early Doppler systems that resided on the DEW Line could be trigger by as little as a dense flock of birds. The early radar data from the DEW Line was processed on the SAGE system a very early (very primitive) system for coordinating a great deal of weather, radar, and flight information.

After WWII and through out the cold war era newer tech was built to solve the issue of coordination. The modern Identification Friend Or Foe system that is now in use provides at least some way to pick apart radar targets.

With the advent of modern computer processing and the ability to analyze radar returns beyond staring at a scope it is possible to determine (with great certainty) the make of an aircraft by its radar signature (and in some cases thermal signature). Also known as Radar Cross Section. Everything (even stealth planes) have a radar cross section and once a cross section has been identified it could be used again to check against future pings.

One could go as far as to say there is some historical precedent around this. The general idea of ""if it comes from over there is one of them, if it comes from over hear its one of us"" is very much how radar worked for a long time and the identification of the actual plane was less important than identifying that it was there. If an unidentified target entered a radar area and did not identify its self, over the radio, with some kind of transponder and or at a preordained time it was intercepted. Not until visual identification was made was it not longer considered a threat.

Here in the states by 2020 the civilian world will be sending speed and position data via ADS-B OUT to supplement (and potentially replace) radar returns.

Riots can certainly be violent and destructive, but still not terrorism.  For example, if somebody breaks into a store to loot merchandise, then that is a criminal act.  But it is not politically motivated or intended to coerce a government or civilian population.  It is motivated by an individual desire to steal stuff.  Vandalism generally does not threaten harm to people, so it can't be terrorism.  Arson is borderline, it could be a terrorist act or it could not be.  It comes down to what is set on fire and who is threatened, for what purpose.  Lighting a trash can on fire is pretty clearly not terrorism, but burning down your local political party headquarters while it is occupied definitely would be terrorism.

In Iraq an occupied embassy was lit on fire by a group of people who were most definitely trying to send a political message.  It checks all the terrorism boxes."	elkxvb	2020-01-09 07:12:34

Most violence that occurred during these riots and protests is generally not connected to any political goals, only crimes of opportunity.  Looting a pair of shoes doesn't have a political purpose.  Setting an embassy on fire does.

There probably is an argument to be made that some of the violence that happened during certain riots and protests have been domestic terrorism.  During the 1992 LA riots you had violent crimes committed against Koreans as a group.  But even then the underlying cause seems to be economic disparity between two geographically adjacent groups.  The targets were not inherently political, but rather the victims of widespread opportunistic crime.  If the Koreans had lived somewhere else then it is unlikely that the rioters would have traveled to the Korean community specifically to loot.

That is “using violence and intimidation against civilians for political ends.” While you can disagree with what the US has done, to argue that US forces used violence AND intimidation against civilians for political ends is absurd. violence was never used as a tool to create fear or panic within the civilian population by US forces."	elkxvb	2020-01-08 13:30:54

We had a serviceable diplomatic agreement with Iran. We, unilaterally pulled out showing were unreliable.

QS was invited to diplomatic talks and assassinated (probably a war crime). We kill envoys.

Then we, publicly on Twitter, promote targeting civilian cultural sites, again war crimes.

sanctions only work if everyone agrees to implement them. No one else is going to help with that.

It's an escalation over Iran's response. And it's blatantly inciting war, which is an escalation.

Threatening to retaliate *if* Iran kills more Americans is an escalation above and beyond Iranian proxies having already killed a US contractor amd stormed a US Embassy? That would be like calling it escalation to yell after someone draws a gun.

>And it's blatantly inciting war, which is an escalation. 

And yet no war has been incited

>Responding with greater threats is escalation. How do you not understand this?

Do you not understand that for something to be an escalation, it has to actually be worse than what came before? Verbal threats are not worse than physical attacks.

None of this matters though because all of this is stuff that already happened. We're talking about what's going to happen from here on out. Which is de-escalation, and if you disagree all you have to do is wait to see that you're wrong."	elkxvb	2020-01-09 12:19:17

Well let's do the math then. Iran:  Sends top general on peace mission. US: Kills general as an illegal act of war in an allies territory without their consent and simultaneously killing allied Iraqis. -1 < 1, yes?
In response. Iran: Threatens to bomb ~30 targets. US: Threatens to bomb 52 targets. 30 < 52, yes?
And while we are at it, lets count the number of times US has overthrown a democratically elected government in Iran: 1. Number of times Iran has overthrown US government 0. 0 < 1?
Number of American civilians killed by Iran or proxies: 0. Number of Iranian civilians killed by US or proxies: thousands. 0 < thousands?
Any way you want to look at this you find the US is the greater aggressor who is always escalating things. Iran is defending itself and the US is a foreign invader trying to control their natural resources.

>Which is de-escalation, and if you disagree all you have to do is wait to see that you're wrong.

Even if Trump's crimes don't trigger all out war, you can be sure there will be increased deaths on both sides under the same warfare that is already taking place. Hatred for America in Iran and Iraq is probably the highest its been since the US invaded those countries."	elkxvb	2020-01-09 13:53:34
