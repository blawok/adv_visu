Sure, it means the same thing, but he didn't use that kind of language.  عقب‌ماندگی This is the word that means retardation in Farsi. It's the same in Iran as it is here as far as the politeness (and PCness) of these specific words goes. ^(.btw I'm a native speaker)

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers.

Edit2:  I know that these words are fundamentally synonyms, but I listened to the speech in Farsi and it is miles away from calling trump a retarded person (once you take connotation into consideration). I also checked BBC Persian and VOA Persian and neither mention this specific quote, nor does any other Persian news site that I am aware of.

*“I’m at this fashion show,” [Vanessa] Trump said, recalling their meeting in 2003. ‘Donald Trump comes up to me with his son: ‘Hi, I’m Donald Trump. I wanted to introduce you to my son Donald Trump Jr.’”*

*The three engaged in a brief, awkward conversation.*

*At intermission, the elder Trump again noticed a gorgeous girl nearby.*

*“Donald comes back up to me again, ‘I don't think you’ve met my son Donald Trump Jr.,’” Vanessa Trump recalled. She remembers responding, “Yeah, we just met, five minutes ago.” . . .*

*Six weeks later, at a birthday party at a [New York] restaurant, they were introduced a third time, this time by a mutual friend. Neither remembered the other. “We talked for an hour,” she recalled.*

*Then suddenly, something clicked: Wait, you were at that fashion show. Wait, you’re . . . “the one with the retarded dad!” Vanessa blurted out.*

So Vanessa Trump, his daughter-in-law, remembered Donald Trump literally as Trump Jr.'s retarded father.

You can't make this shit up. Or you could, but the truth is always more savage than fiction when it comes to this fail family.

Now they're criticizing Trump's decision to call off an air strike that would have started a war. Then Iran pokes the hornets nest further by insulting our administration. It's almost as if they want to go to war with us. I am so fucking tired of my tax dollars going to fund bombs and airstrikes that kill innocent people. I'm fucking done with it but there is no opposition party anymore. This country hasn't seen peace since I was in goddamn middle school, and nobody gives a shit. Everyone is crying for less immigrants, or more advantages for their identity-group, or less taxes, or a different president...No one seems to mind that we've been hemorrhaging money for nearly 2 decades and at whose benefit? The military actions taken to subvert the Taliban and Bin Laden are literally the only justifiable actions we've taken in this entire mess and that's the smallest fraction of our actions. 

But will anything change? No. Everyone is just going to keep crying about the president, keep bitching about having to pay too much in taxes, pretend like anything would change if we elected a democrat, keep squabbling on social media.

1110	1561504448.0	"I understand the craze over Iran's use of the word retardation is semantic, but due the typical dryness of geopolitics some humor is warranted.

More importantly, there were other things I didn't understand. First, how does Bolton's deal -- if Iran does walk through that door-- differ from the previous deal? What do we know about this potential agreement the Trump administration is offering? Secondly, did Iran really say that they don't intend to create nuclear weapons because of their religious views? Iran literally says,""It is us who, because of our religious views, will never pursue a nuclear weapon."" Personally, it's painfully obvious that one cannot use religious beliefs -- which are in essence supernatural-- to justify your actions about nuclear weapons -- which have real life natural consequences of colossal scale. And in my opinion, that statement is also kind of retarded, which illuminates how ironic this whole ordeal is."	c555x4	2019-06-26 01:14:08

It's either ignorance, desire for upvotes or tunnel vision. It's a slippery slope to picking the wrong sides.  


  
Global media uses small subjective phrasing to change sentiment over time on a worldwide scale. Here we're meant to be above using their manipulative strategies be it on purpose or by accident. It's difficult to make a title objective when it's pertaining to your own country, head of state or demographic etc. Doesn't mean we shouldn't try though. We're better than that. But I do acknowledge that it's difficult. Google starts forming search results based on whether you like Trump or not or whether you mean Railroads the game, the town or the means of transport. It's just so easy to read something you're already agreeable about without looking behind the headline just so we could prevent being proven wrong or our logic faulty.

2674	1561491213.0	"Sure, here's a reasonable take on this issue:

* There was a perfectly cromulent agreement (the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons in place, agreed to by all the great-and-nearly-great powers of the world.
* President Donald Trump ripped it up because it was negotiated by his predecessor.
* This results in sanctions not only against Iran but so-called ""secondary sanctions"" against the parties still in the deal who are upholding their commitments under the JCPOA. These secondary sanctions have to be waived by the US to avoid the collateral damage of sanctioning some of our oldest and closest allies.
* The Europeans begin setting up a vehicle (Instex) to continue to fulfill their obligations under the JCPOA while evading US sanctions, but drag their feet a bit for fear of alienating the US.
* Meanwhile, following the advice of the Galaxy Brains who brought us the Iraq War and the North Korean nuclear arsenal, he began a ""maximum pressure"" campaign that isn't working and will not work against a power and a people as proud as the Persians.
* The Iranians then began a series of provocations to ramp up pressure on the Europeans, who are both trying to stay in the deal and not piss off the United States.
* Bolton, Pompeo et. al. are interested in escalating the situation as a result, despite multiple statements from the Iranian leadership that they do not want war. (In fact, they are playing classic politics, trying to split the US and its allies over an issue of central importance to their country.)
* Donald Trump is now trying to avoid a war his own idiocy made possible, while simultaneously taking actions (sanctioning Iranian leadership, including the FM) that make negotiations less likely and war more likely. 

Just to remind you, we're the country that fucked up Iraq, a country half the population of Iran, whose regime truly was a case of oppressive minority rule, and whose land is far more flat and navigable than Iran's.

I'm getting so sick and tired of them doing anything they want and creating problems especially in the middle east, because of stupid reasons. They seem more like bullies than 'world police' by now. And everytime they go into countries to put in new governments or whatever reason they use, it hurt most of the world, as people flee and they often run to Europe. Maybe if they had to take in all the refugees they create, they would stop doing this shit.

3070	1561491823.0	">US the only country in the history to have used nuclear weapons, doesn't want Iran to have nuclear weapons because it effects world peace.

This isn't true. America is the only country to have used the weapons on another nation, multiple countries have tested their firearms in order to further improve them.

Going by your logic should we allow and be accepting of North Koreas access to these weapons? We have them, they have them but the difference is how they test them, where they test them and what they say. North Korea, much like Iran has promoted conflict and in North Koreas case they have tested missles over and near Japan who may I add has been threatened by North Korea on multiple occasions.

I think I and many others would agree North Korea would be better off without those weapons. They have big boy toys and they aren't playing nice.

Why don't we want Iran to have a hold of these weapons?

>At least one missile had ""ישראל צריכה להמחק מעל פני האדמה"" (""Israel must be wiped off the face of the >earth"") written on them in Hebrew.[15] Sources differ on whether the tests violate Security Council >resolutions.[16][17]

>The White House notified lawmakers on Friday that it would declare Iran is violating the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention because it has kept the equipment and facilities needed to produce them, not because it is actively making or using such weapons.

Just two notable examples, I don't have time right now to dedicate to a research paper.

Other countries littered across Europe have missles and we don't have a problem with them. Russia and China have missles and we have minimal issues with them. There's a reason why we have a problem with the nations we do."	c555x4	2019-06-25 21:43:43

> Anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist and anti-American, MEK fighters killed scores of the Shah’s police in often suicidal street battles during the 1970s. The group targeted US-owned hotels, airlines and oil companies, and was responsible for the deaths of six Americans in Iran. “Death to America by blood and bonfire on the lips of every Muslim is the cry of the Iranian people,” went one of its most famous songs. “May America be annihilated.”

> For almost two decades, under their embittered leader Massoud Rajavi, the MEK staged attacks against civilian and military targets across the border in Iran and helped Saddam suppress his own domestic enemies. But after siding with Saddam – who indiscriminately bombed Iranian cities and routinely used chemical weapons in a war that cost a million lives – the MEK lost nearly all the support it had retained inside Iran. Members were now widely regarded as traitors.

....

> The main attraction at this year’s Paris conference was another longtime MEK supporter, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, now Donald Trump’s lawyer. “The mullahs must go. The ayatollah must go,” he told the crowd. “And they must be replaced by a democratic government which Madam Rajavi represents.” Giuliani also praised the work of MEK “resistance units” inside Iran, that he credited with stoking a recent wave of protests over the struggling economy. “These protests are not happening by accident,” he said. “They’re being coordinated by many of our people in Albania.” (Giuliani, Bolton and the late John McCain are among the US politicians who have travelled to Albania to show support for the MEK.)

....

> A stupendously long list of American politicians from both parties were paid hefty fees to speak at events in favour of the MEK, including Giuliani, John McCain, Newt Gingrich and former Democratic party chairs Edward Rendell and Howard Dean – along with multiple former heads of the FBI and CIA. John Bolton, who has made multiple appearances at events supporting the MEK, is estimated to have received upwards of $180,000. According to financial disclosure forms, Bolton was paid $40,000 for a single appearance at the Free Iran rally in Paris in 2017."	c555x4	2019-06-25 21:34:21

3295	1561497626.0	I guess so. This actually happens quite often with headlines that quote Iranian politicians but this one takes the cake. It might be intentional, but the connotation is something that is often lost in translation. I spent my childhood and teen years in Iran, so I'm more or less familiar with the overtone of the vocabulary. However, I still have trouble with the connotation of some words after so many years. So it could just be a translator who hasn't lived in Iran or isn't Iranian.	c555x4	2019-06-25 23:20:26
3296	1561506083.0	It doesn't matter regardless. Both translations amount to the same insult.	c555x4	2019-06-26 01:41:23

I totally understand how it looks that way if you’re not familiar with the alphabet—the words do look close together—but anybody who speaks the language can see that it’s the start of a new word at least because of the way the words are connected—similar to capital letters in English, you draw most letters differently if they’re at the beginning or end of a word.

* **China:** Instead of tackling the issue of China head on he went to do the TPP, one of the most notorious corporate shilling agreements in history, that was so bad **both** presidential candidates wanted it gone (Hillary more as a lip service as Bernie pushed her on it, but still).

* **Wars:** wtf, he was a fucking cesar of blood, vastly expending drone strikes and extra-judicial killings, and for some odd reason kept the war in Afghanistan going strong. At least he withdraw from Iraq, but even that was poorly done, and it's completely destabilized. In addition, he also led another oil-based war on Libya. 

* **World Terror:** His deferentionist FP (Foreign Policy) have left a huge power vaccum in the middle east, leading Russia to eventually set foot there in order to ""combat ISIS"", a task he failed to do. Killing Bin Laden was good and well, but it was more to satisfy revenge than actual geopolitical need at that point.

* **Global Threats:** Russia and NK went practically unchecked, with NK finally getting their hands on atomic weapons. If you like the Iran deal, he did help at least delay or even defuse this threat, although many critics say this deal was far from hermetic, and could possibly have just led to another NK. [I will give him credit for trying to tackle this tough issue however]

* **Human Rights:** Again, super deferential, leading to no improvement in human rights around the world as human rights abusers met no resistance from the American admin's realpolitik (And yes, as leader of the free world, he has a higher bar to set than just the US needs) - From Saudi Arabia to China, Obama didn't give a shit.

* **Climate Change:** Credit given where credit is due, The Paris Accords were a huge step for a country like the US, who backtracked from the Kyoto protocol under Bush Jr. and was generally a dick about it.

* **Refugees:** In his tenure one of the worst refugee crisis in the world has happened, one that the US did little to alleviate, leaving the job to Europe. Meanwhile, deportations in the US hit record high.

""Mentally retarded"" is also relatively modern - a doctor in the beginning if the 20th century would have described the President of the US as a ""moron"", seeing as he appears to be more capable than an ""idiot"" (IQ 0-25) or an ""imbecile"" (25-50).

Don't get me wrong, there was A LOT wrong with this classification. Especially with how the term ""moron"" came to be and how it ended up influencing the world. But they were legitimate medical terms, and ""mentally retarded"" still remains this way in a lot of the more obscure English terminology. It's reasonable to assume that a lot of languages didn't follow this development."	c555x4	2019-06-26 00:01:57

""bitch whore"" is the translation. The only complication is that блядь can be used very loosely, often as what Wictionary generously refers to as a ""(vulgar) discourse particle"" - a filler word. So the alternate translation is ""fucking bitch"" - the bitch isn't meant to be interpreted as literally ""fucking"", but the insult is heightened and the speaker's disposition towards her is unambiguously negative."	c555x4	2019-06-26 01:28:48

3622	1561492013.0	"You're not wrong. I don't think that disabled people should be made fun of. It's not their fault that they're born this way.

The problem is that the American people gave this stupid, vain, narcissist power over the largest military in the world and he's playing chicken with a serious regional power who could shut down the oil through the straight of Hormuz and the spike in prices would cause a worldwide depression. Further, the US can't win against Iran. Not without either international help, which he won't get, or a draft, because to occupy a country you need one soldier for every fifty civilians. That's not to mention its terrain, which is often desert and mountains. It's people, who are pretty young. It's military, which is one of the best in the world. Top ten.

Also by picking a fight with them, we pick a fight with Russia, their ally, who is a nuclear armed power. And this sort of conflict could devolve into no shit World War Three. It is a nightmare scenario for generals.

Add to this the humanitarian crisis that would be precipitated by waging war on people who haven't really done the US any offense in something like 35 years at the behest of Saudi Arabia (and their most major offense was throwing off an English and US backed dictator, the Shah of Iran), as they're in the midst of a regional cold war. Saudi, of which the majority of he 9/11 attackers came from. There is no moral reason to attack Iran. There are certainly all sorts of strategic reasons not to attack Iran. And yet, Trump wants to attack Iran.

So yeah, the R word is bad. I agree. I will say that in the scope of what I'm speaking of, I'll use it to undermine the authority of an incompetent, violent, narcissistic bully because diminishing his authority through petty attacks works to undermine him because he is a petty man. Doing so is important and I'll use what tools I have at hand to fling dirt on him.

Remember that this is the man that has thrown 60k children in concentration camps in the last 40 days and his administration has argued in front of a judge that children don't need toothbrushes, soap, blankets, medicine, etc. That they just need to sleep on a cold, concrete floor and suffer in their filth. And if you've never slept on concrete before, and I have, it just sucks the warmth from your body. You freeze on concrete.

The problem is not a small sin that people quibble about, or not my main concern. It is the larger ones that this man commits on a daily basis. If you are concerned about use of a word, a small sin, perhaps also concern yourself with the abuse of defenseless people by flinging them into concentration camps, a far, far larger one reminiscent of Nazi Germany. And I will undermine him, even if it is only with my words."	c555x4	2019-06-25 21:46:53

Trump was a billionaire at the time. Big in New York circles. Also if you're a New Yorker, you're basically primed to hate him.

There's Donald Trump Jr. This is one of Trump's sons. A nobody if not Trump's son.

And there's Vanessa Trump, who was not a Trump yet. She marries into the family through Don Jr.

They're all at a party. She (Vanessa) meets up with Trump and his son, Don Jr. And they make awkward conversation. Then Trump comes back five minutes later, not even remembering her. Not just her name, but her at all.

Months later, they meet up again a third time. And she has a hard time remembering them until she remembers that Trump is Don Jr.'s idiot father. She doesn't remember Don Jr. save for being defined by how dumb his father was.

Two years later, Don Jr. and Vanessa get married. And thirteen years later, they get divorced."	c555x4	2019-06-25 22:28:22

Now it could have been the forgetting, which is possible. It could have been the insane rambling about himself, which is probably 100% likely as he's a clinical narcissist. But it's the fact that Don Jr. married this woman after that was how she remembered him. Not for Don Jr. himself, but his father, who she remembered as retarded, and Don Jr. was defined in her memory by said retarded father.

Trump made an impression on his future daughter-in-law. And that impression was pathetic."	c555x4	2019-06-25 21:11:44

Iran has abided by the US-ratified nuclear deal in good faith.

He has already lost one war game already, the trade war game. He assumed China would blink, lost, and now  American farmers and industry who have lost and are paying the price. Where's your outrage about it?

Trump will do whatever suits *his* personal needs. He doesn't care a whit for your needs or for America's needs. If the coward and 5-time draft dodger needs a war to retain presidency and escape prosecution, then he'll wage a war irrespective of the death toll."	c555x4	2019-06-25 22:34:16

If you think this is the only reason the original deal was ripped up then you have been living in a leftist echo chamber for the last 2 years while Iran rapidly expanded their ballistic missiles program against the terms of the agreement and the pleads of the UN.    
         
>Since the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal, Tehran’s ballistic missile program continues to pose a serious threat to the United States, its allies, and its strategic interests in the Middle East. Iran has test-fired nuclear-capable ballistic missiles at least ten times since July 2015, despite a UN Security Council resolution, approved along with the nuclear accord, which explicitly calls on Iran to refrain from such activity. Iran has shown no signs of slowing the development of its ballistic missile program, which is inextricably intertwined with its nuclear program.

""Iranians say their ‘bones breaking’ under US sanctions""

""But under Trump’s maximum-pressure campaign, the U.S. has cut off Iran’s ability to sell crude on the global market, and threatened to sanction any nation that purchases it. Oil covers a third of the $80 billion a year the government spends in Iran, meaning that a fall in oil revenues cuts into its social welfare programs, as well as its military expenditures.""

""Inflation is over 37%, according to government statistics. More than 3 million people, or 12% of working-age citizens, are unemployed. That rate doubles for educated youth.""

&#x200B;

Like most liberals, Obama was too weak to deal with Iran. Iranians dont fuck around. They're a masculine culture and you need a strong man to deal with them. They are playing the waiting game now to see if Trump stays because they know liberals will be too weak and stupid to handle Iranian games."	c555x4	2019-06-26 03:14:52

4303	1561500659.0	I was mostly kidding. I speak a lot of languages, Aramaic included, but not Farsi... but one thing I always caution people about is taking literal translations at face value.

Not to mention the government support of terrorist actions and the ongoing hate for Israel. Basically, yeah I don’t support war but at the same time I certainly don’t support Iran.

Iran before the revolution was the #1 US ally in the region. But given US interference in Iranian politics, the Public resented the relationship and rightfully so. They were suffering under brutal dictatorship of an American imposed King whose security apparatus particularly the Savak had a fearsome reputation for torture and silencing of dissent. The public anger eventually reached its boiling point and the revolution erupted.....which was hijacked by the clergy (Because no one else was speaking for the people) who turned a people's revolution to a religious revolution. This is the problem US has with many of their regional allies, they try to interfere too much, they try to milk the cow too hard. And that is why American perception is never positive in those areas unlike let's say Western Europe because America rarely interferes in European internal affairs."	c555x4	2019-06-25 20:37:51

When in reality they were both being irrational and Obama's presidency wasnt THAT different from GWB jr. Yes there were some liberal policies enacted but at the end of the day Obama was a centrist Democrat that stayed in party lines.

But in western countries women have to cover up more than men legally too. And the places they are supposed to cover up are generally considered pretty, and capable of inciting jealousy. Iran takes that to a further extreme considering more parts of women pretty and capable of inciting jealousy. Nuts to them right? They have behind the rest of the world in women's rights and will take some time to agree on what can be done to serve justice, the same as other countries did; without interruption from foreign cultures. Politics is always a back and forth, if the state became more repressive after the islamic revolution, maybe some lesson has been learned, then again maybe a majority of people  think there have been appropriate steps taken.	c555x4	2019-06-26 02:29:18

As the article states, the post-1979 regime sees the Baha'is as loyal subjects to the Shah. Certainly doesn't excuse any killings, but this seems more political than genocidal. The same is true of your link regarding the Iranian government going after political opponents in the immediate aftermath of the Iran Iraq War. Definitely despicable violence regardless of what anyone says, but also more politically-motivated in my view instead of some grand genocidal plan.

The claim that Iran has partnered with Assad to carry out genocide against Sunni Arabs is in my opinion the weakest supporting link that you provided (besides the Ahmedinejad link that just mentions that he's said bad things about the Israeli government?). That author seems to be confusing self-preservation with genocide. Iran naturally seeks to build relationships with Assad and Putin so as to not be alone in the region waiting for the next brigade of US/Britain freedom fighters to arrive. They back rebels in Yemen and the Saudis bomb the rebels and anyone nearby. It's a geopolitical struggle for territory, resources, and influence, but I think it's a serious stretch to say that it's rooted in genocidal aims. The article even goes as far to compare ISIS to Iran and suggests that Iran is somehow just as evil as ISIS since their violence is displacing Sunni groups for the alleged benefit of Iran?

The same sanctioning of medicine that the International Criminal Court found to be in violation of international law? The same Court that after issuing said ruling, the United States, instead of complying, pulled out from entirely?

You are either not informing yourself of the entire recent history, have the attention spawn of a small child, or are willfully simplifying this by ignoring the fact that the US has been acting in bad faith since trump entered office.

Most liberal redditors that live and breath the main news subs and /r/politics are just polar opposites of the people in The_Donald, they just aren't capable of admitting it.  It's like two drunk people at the bar late at night and both of them are loud and opinionated and bothering everyone around them but they just haven't stumbled from one side of the bar to the middle yet to bump into each other but you just KNOW it's coming any moment now and then BOOM, election time!, and they bump into each other and start fighting and screaming at each other.  Does that mean all the rest of the people in the bar are as delusional as the two drunks about to fight? No, it doesn't.  But all those people aren't acting out publicly.

All the while they are fighting they both think stupidly that they are the informed ones in the room who have the BESTEST opinions and they think the center of attention they are receiving by being drunk buffoons(in this analogy:  loud and vocal and other ""drunks"" around them being loud and vocal) validates this belief, i.e. - their echo chambers.

But at the end of the day, they are both basically the town idiots.  It's horse shoe theory playing out in real time.  It's just that the internet has allowed all of the town idiots to amass into large groups and believe they have more legitimacy in the real world than they actually do.

Stability is the only factor that decides it and Iran is very stable, their government is fully in control of everything that goes on there.

But he makes almost anything he touches look like snake oil so he’s not a good example of anything except rampant narcissism."	c555x4	2019-06-26 06:47:00

Trump is the only one making democracy anything more than a hidden way to genocide people and colonize them in their own homelands. Without Trump democracy in pea rice is the new covert Nazism that only exists to colonize and genocide."	c555x4	2019-07-16 07:42:50

Since he is no closer to any kind of justice, despite his crimes, treason and fraudulent election hes still the president and almost half the people still support this toddler minded authoritarian. He should have been removed from office after Helsinki and tried for crimes against humanity for the child separations,.

The fact that the word retard has traumatic associations to many people with actual disabilities has no bearing on it's utility as an insult. To say that a non-disabled individual 'suffers intellectual incapacity"" is exactly the same insult as ""retard""."	c555x4	2019-06-26 06:43:15

I kind of get that it’s confusing, some black people hold on to their African heritage and others don’t. It has less to do with direct bloodlines and more with cultural inheritance/choice. Just like there are Jewish people who are 100% adherents and others who are only a bit ‘culturally’ Jewish. 

The Obamas are, like, as American as it gets. If you flung them in Kenya they’d very much be fish out of water, I imagine. Skin tone and ethnic heritage do not make someone’s identity.

Calling them African is perceived negatively not because there’s something wrong with being African, but because of the many, many fucktards who claimed Obama was “not really American”, “born in Kenya” (spoiler alert, he wasn’t)... one of whom is donald trump. It’s a loaded phrase because of those people. Otherwise it would merely be semantics, but because of the “birther” conspiracy theorists, it’s now a loaded racial issue.

To answer your question for real, he has African heritage on his dad’s side, Kenyan to be exact. His mom was white and he was born and raised in the US. Some people think that makes him African.

Why do you think he was pretty solid? I laid out what I think are core issues of FP. He failed miserably in many of them (plenty of times due to misaction that led to enemies proactively dictating world affairs, others in blood-thirst and corporate shilling). So what was so solid?

I didn't say he had to be a great global leader. An adequate one would have sufficed. Instead, he was overall an E or D- at best.

Strong presindents include Monroe (with the Monroe Doctrine), Teddy Roosevelt (with Gunboat Diplomacy), FDR as a wartime president is a stellar example of one that really rose to the occasion, but even in modern times Regan finally brought the Cold War to a conclusion and boldly exported the values of liberalism, telling Gorbachev to ""tear down this wall"". 

He doesn't have to be an all-time great, but he was far, far from that. Hell, even Clinton led to peace accords in the middle east (Jordan and Israel. Carter also brokered to much more critical Egypt-Israel, although there most of the credit goes to the leaders of those countries). Where is Obama's signature moment?"	c555x4	2019-06-26 00:49:41

This is political nonspeak that even for a german is hard to understand. In German, evidence can be clear, unambiguous, strong, conclusive, or weak etc., but never high or low.

What she probably meant is that there is ""a lot of evidence"" to consider before chosing a considerate response urging all participants for a peaceful solution.

Meanwhile people like you side with the terrorists by undermining the wise decision. You're a fool and a disgrace to this country for blaming our president (because it fits your contempt for him)to end bribes to terrorists instead of blaming the actual terrorists. 

This is Irans hope - to make trump look like the source of chaos for ending this agreement rather than see Iran as the actual problem who nobody in this world can trust to have nukes. And get the EU to pressure trump back to the agreement which was horrible. They are terrorists...the only thing preventing them from using nukes is bribery because they are so poor.

Treatment of women is bad, but then its better than how Saudi treats its women, another top US ally.

Imprisoning diplomats....not sure who you are talking about, but yes Iran has issues with imprisoning people for dumb reasons. Same with other top US allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia. The US itself hosts the most prisoners per capita by a long shot. They have many issues with imprisoning people on spurious grounds.

Judicial punishment...you know where I am going with this. Top US allies consider luring journalists into embassies and dismembering them as a form of judicial punishment.

Treatment of LGBT persons. Once again, they have problems. So do most of the world sadly, including many top US allies.

So my point is, none of these reasons you listed justify Iran being seen as a rogue state worthy of invasion, as many US allies behave in exactly the same manner, if not worse and are still lavished with praise by the US and given 100s of billions of dollars worth of weaponry to use against others and their own people should they dare rise up against their governments."	c555x4	2019-06-25 20:33:43

I've heard this argument too. But the reality is that Trump is absolutely the ultimate narcissist in every conceivable way. **He checks all the boxes in black indelible marker.**

NPD is a personality disorder that's more likely to cause significant personal distress *externally* - to the people who have to deal personally with the narcissist.  

Normal narcissists suffer because of the disorder's effects on the people close to the narcissist. The narcissist suffers blowback from people who just aren't going to take the sh!t the narcissists tries to pull. They often can't keep a steady job or pay their bills, and they can't be trusted.

In Trump's case the personal consequences to his disorder are successfully mitigated by his wealth and status. People bend over backwards for him and give him FAR more latitude than they'd ever give to a normal person.  

So, no *he* doesn't suffer. In fact, he's likely very glad to not be a normal person, because he truly believes he's superior to us all."	c555x4	2019-06-25 22:27:48

> But lots of successful people are extremely narcissistic without being mentally ill — think most celebrities, many politicians, and a fair percentage of writers, artists, lawyers, doctors, and professors. To qualify for narcissistic personality disorder, an individual’s selfish, unempathetic preening must be accompanied by significant distress or impairment. Trump certainly causes severe distress and impairment in others, but his narcissism doesn’t seem to affect him that way.

This is also reiterated in the DSM-5:
>  Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder.

It's my personal opinion that this is the stigma that needs to be dissolved first, and not the linguistic hurdle.   

On the other, just because someone in a community uses a slur to refer to themselves with ownership and grace, doesn't mean that everyone else gets a free pass.

First of all, when people refer to ""Wall Street"", they're talking specifically about banking, high finance, stock trading. Further, the twin towers weren't actually *on* Wall Street.

I am the furthest thing from a fascist, homeboy. You need to learn who to actually use that word on, because you cheapen it when you use it on people who are trying to just instruct you in basic empathy. This is a completely separate matter from anyone's concept about effective or moral governance.

I can agree that most people are a part of gross machine, that their priorities are often misguided, that the system in which this all occurs needs vast and sweeping reforms. But it's obnoxious of you, utterly childish and counter-productive, to get all righteously indignant about the fact that people go about their lives... working. Providing for their families.

There's a saying in the statistics profession of ""all models are wrong, some are useful."" Intelligence in humans is an outrageously complex and nuanced topic one of which we barely understand.

The EU was aware, but largely ignored it, and Trump decided it was a deal breaker.

X laundered money and went to summer camp in 5th grade. So it’s implied anyone that went to summer camp is suspicious even if they don’t launder money. We’re told a fact we’d probably agree with then told an additional piece of information that may not relate but the listener makes the connection while the speaker doesn’t have to come out and say it. In politics we’re told so and so party member did this bad thing. It’s repeated over and over which reinforces the idea that if someone is a group of that party then they’re part of a bad crowd and its reasonable to assume they’ve done something bad too. Maybe I’m blowing this out of proportion. Glad someone sees what I’m getting at though. 

I’m not taking sides by the way. I think the media in general regardless of source is guilty of it and I think that’s carried through into public political discourse, which is exemplified on these subreddits. Well, and in the real world too whether it’s baking a wedding cake or refusing service at your restaurant, right? Isn’t an association being made that’s somewhat incorrect, or projected? Maybe it’s just the difference between engagement. Are we actually trying to solve a problem or rhetorically debate?

They should be appealing to the working class and the poor, but they focused so much of their rhetoric over the last decade on identity politics that it has crippled their ability to message this way.  You're not going to accomplish anything significant in the short term as divisive as things are and with the economy in a slow recession.  Politicians are on the defensive when the economy is not doing well.

They are also pro-immigration at a time when we bring in 1 million+ new citizens a year(legally) and automation is bearing down on us, constantly displacing lower skilled jobs, and increasing at an exponential rate, meanwhile they ask for increased social programs and increased taxation at the same time.  It's self contradictory and extremely obvious to a large portion of the population, specifically those in the middle or later of their careers (middle aged people and older) but because democrat messaging has been dominated in recent years by the younger college aged and <30 demographic the democrat messaging has shifted to them too heavily, and is disproportionately off balance, in my opinion.   There is truth to the thought on the right that the working class is just being subsidized by foreign workers.... this is something the democrats have participated in as much as the republicans and a soft spot for them.  Personally, I blame the Clintons for selling out the party that way.

I think pandering to things like reparations and forgiving all student loan debt are cheap tactics that signify their addiction to identity politics and their failing message that will continue to fail.  I think the democratic politicians are too hip to hip with the mainstream news media and as such they believe that the media will direct them to the worthy causes, which couldn't be further from the truth.  They have become reflections of the media in some ways, like an unhealthy symbiotic/parasitic infection.  Both parties need to disengage from each other to improve themselves (both the democratic politicians and the news media).

Messaging from Yang and Gabbard is good, I think.  The rest of them seem like hot garbage and I don't think Sanders supporters are honest with themselves about the amount of pandering he does.  He's not the ""stand and face the storm"" personality they think he is.  He's a career politician set in his ways."	c555x4	2019-06-26 01:09:30

6040	1561501270.0	"Keep in mind that there is a very big difference between Iraq's government and military and insurgents living in the country.

Iraq's government and military were brought to its knees in a matter of a couple weeks.

During desert storm, there were over 100,000 Iraqi soldier deaths to a mere 383 US fatalities. Iran just like Iraq is horribly outgunned in terms of technological advancements. They can give tanks and AKs to as many young boys as they want, but none of that comes close to a coordinated attack from a US aerial assault.

The problem isn't destroying Iran's military, production and government. That can be done in a blink of an eye...it's building it back up that's the problem.

On the surface it seems like people talking is always good as it's dialogue. In the diplomatic world, it's always a bit different and high-level talks are always carefully orchestrated to show equality by the parties. By going to a 1:1 summit, Trump has given legitimacy to the regime the US (And most other countries) have levied sanctions against. 

Time will tell if it was a good move but based on past experiences and diplomatic conventions, it was bet the US took and it hasn't paid off yet. Most agree that Trump has been fooled into thinking this meeting would result in concrete changes.

This has also been NK's mode of operation for decades where they seem to open up to release pressure on them, only to sink even deeper in isolation. For example, the IAEA inspection of reactors being accepted as foreign aid arrives and denied once the last delivery is complete. The rhetoric between agreeing to dismantle enrichment factories and annihilating the West with nuclear weapons. The back and forth on the six parties talk. NK doesn't want to negotiate, they want to be seen as legitimate and see having nuclear weapons as their only option for survival."	c555x4	2019-06-26 08:19:47

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index)

I sincerely hope you're not defending authoritarian regimes as proper forms of government. 

Did you know who compilied that list? It's from a British media company. It's not bad but the fact that their rating scale led to the UK being the only full democracy is silly [(especially when you consider there laws regarding freedom of expression have glaring issues)](https://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2016/03/07/it-s-time-to-scrap-the-ban-on-satirising-parliament) and don't get me started on their banking shenanigans (look up city of London). There are no full democracies. But being a relatively stable, westernized democracy with rights protecting free speech should be a prerequisite to becoming a nuclear power in today's world. 

>While I do agree that nuclear weapons should not be proliferated and we should all work to eventually phase them out

This will never happen as long as border disputes are still occurring. Frankly I'm fine with that. Nukes are one of the main reasons why there hasn't been another major war since WW2. Pick your poison: massive wars between competing super powers or the threat of nuclear armageddon.

>destroy the knowledge base

Are you saying to destroy knowledge on how to build nukes? 


 >Democracy is no valid argument in deciding who is and who isn't a responsible Nuclear power? Stability is the only factor that decides it and Iran is very stable, their government is fully in control of everything that goes on there. 

I said westernized democracy. Or more specifically classical liberal representative democracy. A parliamentary system can work as well but there needs to be a major emphasis on individual rights and separation of powers among government institutions (i.e. judicial vs legislative)

>Of course that doesn't mean that Iran should be allowed to build nukes, but that should solely be based on ethical reasons; not because ""oh they are muslims"", ""oh they are not a democracy"" since that's obviously irrelevant.

I never defended the idea of preventing a country from owning nukes because of religious reasons. I am deeply concerned about a country's government and stability though."	c555x4	2019-06-28 09:50:13

We go so far as making them tax exempt but they are prohibited from getting involved in politics. That line is constantly being pushed to favor religious views when they get power. That is the nature of organized religion, they KNOW they are right and nothing can away them, it is the proverbial slippery slope.
 Name a successful Theocracy from the viewpoint of a person who lives in a secular democracy, I say it can't be done. Evangelical types are all the same, my way or the highway types.

For this to be whataboutism I would need to be excusing Trump’s behavior by saying they did it too.

The reason democracy has exploded all over the world and is now almost the norm as opposed to a rarity, was the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting freedom of elections.  If there was ever an election the Soviet Union didn’t interfere in, it was an oversight on their part.

The founding fathers never anticipated someone like Trump and his Cult doing what they're doing right now. I'm being pessimistic, but I do not think the US will be able to withstand what Trump is currently trying to do with the GOP's help. Given how much damage they're doing and how the Cult keeps cheering them on, we could see a Constitutional Convention soon, where the GOP gets to re-write the Constitution in their image.

Taking away the cold war context would be like saying how evil America was for bombing poor Germany.    Of course the United States installed and supported dictators, funded rebels, and even overthrew elected leaders.  They were fighting an appointment who did all of the same things, and I would argue, more effectively.  Anybody noticed there are twice as many people on the planet and very, very little war going on?

Yes, it's true that if you flung Barack Obama to Kenya he'd be a fish out of water, but this is true of many children of immigrants in the US, and those children still identify both as American and as the ethnicity of their parents. My parents were born in Sri Lanka, but I was born in Los Angeles. I'm just as American as Barack Obama, but I'm also Sri Lankan - my parents raised me with certain values and cultural norms that my white friends didn't have, that my black friends didn't have, and that my Hispanic friends didn't have. I have friends born in America who wouldn't take offense if you called them Chinese. The same for my Japanese friends, Cuban friends, and Guyanese friends. Because that's their identity - that's the food they eat, the language they speak, the act of taking your shoes of in the house or playing a game of carrom/mahjong/insert-cultural-game-here.

Judging from the replies to my comment, and in general, judging from how white Americans perceive race, it seems like many white Americans just want to ignore the backgrounds of all the different types of people in this country. This may be for many different reasons - maybe white Americans have been in this country for so many generations that they don't appreciate having their ancestral identity anymore and therefore can't appreciate it in others; maybe white Americans find it uncomfortable to deal with their unconscious biases when they're forced to acknowledge the different identities of all the different Americans in this country. Well, when people call me ""Mohammad"" (spoiler: that's not my name), when people yell ""Fuck you!"" at the street to me the day before July 4th, it becomes clear that there is a pocket of people in this country who are well aware of how different I am, and it becomes hard for *me* to ignore my identity. So I don't ask all the rest of society to *ignore* my identity as a brown man in America - I ask the rest of non-racist America to *embrace* my identity as a brown man.

Who knows how much of Barack Obama's Kenyan identity he clings on to? I just know that I don't find it a coincidence that [the first sitting US president to visit Kenya is also of Kenyan heritage.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/barack-obamas-trips-kenya-now/story?id=32650996) Why is everyone trying to white-wash this man's identity? His father born in Kenya, he was born in Hawaii, he was raised in Malaysia, and then went on to pursue great things in America. *What a fucking story.*

>Calling them African is perceived negatively not because there’s something wrong with being African, but because of the many, many fucktards who claimed Obama was “not really American”, “born in Kenya” (spoiler alert, he wasn’t)

See, that's not where I was coming from. I was coming from the perspective of: Barack Obama is half-Kenyan, and that's *awesome*. This whole time I thought only white people could become president. But now I know that maybe even a Sri Lankan like me can do it."	c555x4	2019-07-02 04:00:09

Individual States are doing FAR more than our federal government is to work on climate change. Other states may follow suit as people see it working out for other states.

State politics, at the very least, are more effective vehicles to change than national politics in our current climate where the federal government is basically non-functional. 

Writing local government off to just pothole votes is a gross under-appreciation for how local politics affect the larger governments they support as well as the other local governments around them."	c555x4	2019-06-25 23:26:33

The issue was warheads not missiles, and the idea was that by attacking the root issue of fissile material production and enrichment you could ensure that the warhead capability wasn't there. 

Furthermore, most Iranian missile tests since the conclusion of the JCPOA have been short range missiles designed to hit targets in the Middle East.

> They are also pro-immigration at a time when we bring in 1 million+ new citizens a year(legally) and automation is bearing down on us, constantly displacing lower skilled jobs, and increasing at an exponential rate, meanwhile they ask for increased social programs and increased taxation at the same time. It's self contradictory and extremely obvious to a large portion of the population, specifically those in the middle or later of their careers (middle aged people and older) but because democrat messaging has been dominated in recent years by the younger college aged and <30 demographic the democrat messaging has shifted to them too heavily, and is disproportionately off balance, in my opinion. There is truth to the thought on the right that the working class is just being subsidized by foreign workers.... this is something the democrats have participated in as much as the republicans and a soft spot for them. Personally, I blame the Clintons for selling out the party that way. 

&#x200B;

Being pro immigration isn't a bad thing, especially when the country has a negative birth rate.   I disagree with both democrats and republicans when it comes to immigration and border security, so I'm not going to defend either side here.  IMO dems have to focus on that age group, bc the older generation is voting republican and dems aren't going to win them back in this environment.

> I think pandering to things like reparations and forgiving all student loan debt are cheap tactics that signify their addiction to identity politics and their failing message that will continue to fail. I think the democratic politicians are too hip to hip with the mainstream news media and as such they believe that the media will direct them to the worthy causes, which couldn't be further from the truth. They have become reflections of the media in some ways, like an unhealthy symbiotic/parasitic infection. Both parties need to disengage from each other to improve themselves (both the democratic politicians and the news media). 

&#x200B;

I think talking about things like reparations is extremely important, and unfortunately so toxic to some of the country that it'll never get its due.  I believe that elevating people in certain communities would be a huge boost economically to all of us and I'm disappointed that we can't talk about it.  I don't know the answers, and I'm not going to debate the topic, I just think we need to talk about it and the GOP is not willing.

&#x200B;

I spend a lot of time in northern europe, so the student debt thing is a no brainer to me.  It's insane that we are allowing an entire generation to go this deep in dept to get degrees that are no longer as relevant as they used to be.  We need to constantly be figuring out ways to make sure that our youth are ahead of the rest of the world, and right now we aren't doing that.  We're essentially allowing an entire generation to be enslaved by their debt.  Completely unacceptable.   Not saying dems, or Bernie Sanders, have the right answers, but sitting on our hands will not work.  This bubble will burst. 

&#x200B;

I'm not a democrat.  I think the party is a mess.  I understand why they suck so bad at working together and staying on message, but I really wish they'd figure it out because in my opinion the republican party is moving this country in the wrong direction.

When you drive you use oil that came from these ""evil Muslim countries"". When you use a phone you use a phone using materials gathered by some kid scavenging in wrecking yards in India. 

You LOVE these backwards countries because you get cheap shit from them. These are actually happening right now unlike with your imaginary communist and anarchist societies.

>**Trump**: ""Excuse me, excuse me. They didn’t put themselves -- and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group. Excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.""

>**Reporter**: ""George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.""

>**Trump**: ""George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down -- excuse me, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him?""

>**Reporter**: ""I do love Thomas Jefferson.""

>**Trump**: ""Okay, good. Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue?

>""So you know what, it’s fine. You’re changing history. You’re changing culture. And you had people -- **and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists -- because they should be condemned totally.** But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.

>""Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people. But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group.""


The key part just so you can read it again.

>**and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists -- because they should be condemned totally.**

The issue is that Iran holds a moral and reasonable high ground in a serious topic that actually matters on the international scale and that is a position they should have never been allowed to take. There is quite a massive political struggle in my country to build distance from the US for their behaviour is so erratic as of recent.

It’s almost like someone in the US administration desperately wants a war with Iran and has a pre-packaged puppet government ready to install once Iran is finally pushed to its breaking point and the some act by a frustrated fanatic in the Iranian security establishment gives a pretext for an invasion.

>There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.

>There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.

>It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the ​annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.

>The second expedient is as impracticable, as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of Government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.

>The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning Government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for preëminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other, than to coöperate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful ​distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions, and excite their most violent conflicts. But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold, and those who are without property, have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern Legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the Government.

>No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause; because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? and what are the different classes of Legislators, but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction, must be expected to prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be differently decided by the ​landed and the manufacturing classes; and probably by neither, with a sole regard to justice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party, to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling, with which they overburden the inferior number, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.

>It is in vain to say, that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm: Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all, without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another, or the good of the whole.

>The inference to which we are brought is, that the causes of faction cannot be removed; and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects.

>If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular Government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good, and private rights, against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular Government, is then the great object to which ​our inquiries are directed: Let me add, that it is the great desideratum, by which this form of Government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.

>By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority, at the same time, must be prevented; or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together; that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.

>From this view of the subject, it may be concluded, that a pure Democracy, by which I mean a Society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the Government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of Government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party, or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is, that such Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of Government, have erroneously supposed, that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the ​same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.

>A Republic, by which I mean a Government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking.

I think that everyone has done good and bad things. Some people are good, but being a good person doesn't mean that every single thing you have ever done is good. I'm sure Mother Teresa did something vaguely bad (at least by *someone's standards*) once. Similarly, I think that Hitler did some good things even though I think Hitler was a monster. My Grandmother spent three years in Terezin, I know what Hitler did.

7147	1561497242.0	"Because a normal curve is a density curve (meaning it describes a continuous random variable), technically, the probability of an IQ of 100 specifically is zero (since there are an infinite number of outcomes on a density curve; it could be 99.9, 99,999, 99.9999, and so on).

We’re inclined to think that zero probability means an event cannot occur. In the case of discrete functions (finite number of outcomes), that is indeed true. If there is no ace of spades in a deck of cards, the probability that you pull an ace of spaces is zero. That means your not pulling an ace of spades.

So why does it matter? Well, a simplified way to put it is that an infinite sum of measure zero events can add up to a positive sum. While the probability of someone having an of 100 IQ is 0 (as one point), the probability of someone having an IQ between 95 and 105 (as an infinite sum of measure zero points) most certainly is not.

TL;DR: Yes, the probability of 100 IQ is zero. No, that does not mean 100 IQ people do not exist."	c555x4	2019-06-25 23:14:02

I’m not grateful at all for the US. Just like the lucky sequence of events that put Earth on the map, the same can be said for the US being the superpower it is today. With Trump as face of the US, it commands economic blackmail of its “allies”, who must affiliate due to such intense integration with the US and its mechanisms.

7246	1561492553.0	">How can you genuinely think the US is the best country in the world?

Not OP, but I'll give it a go:

The U.S. is unique in that it is both wealthy *and* a large, diverse nation. The only other countries that approach or exceed our wealth on a per capita basis are tiny in population; the only ones with populations close to ours (or many times larger in the cases of China and India) are poor or a mess. 

Unlike Europe, we enjoy the distinct advantages of being energy independent, agriculturally independent, and militarily independent, again a unique quality not found in any other country.

For to these reasons, we are able to enjoy freedom from the arbitrary whims of other nations, as we are not dependent on Russian gas to keep the lights on, or on an agreement from a past era to defend us, leading to the ultimate form of self-determination, which extends to the citizens and is protected on the individual level by the Bill of Rights.

Our culture values the individual (though internal forces are trying to change this) and allows each person to make the most of himself, and is a center for scientific advancement, as people are drawn from around the world to compete and participate in top research universities and institutions like the CDC.

We are bold in that we attempt to educate everyone, and foster an environment that allows everyone to attempt to make advancements or build a business so as to his abilities. We protect free speech (also under fire..) and allow people to be wrong in their ideas, so that they can seek truth unimpeded.

In these manners, perhaps Canada and Japan come close. But no one else competes for best nation, IMO."	c555x4	2019-06-25 21:55:53

Eh, I have a family member that works for an investment wing of Goldman.  She doesn't agree.  Also, look at gold and digital currency over the last 2 year period.   They correspond to market recession.  I'm not saying I'm an expert at economics but I'm not retarded at it either.

The slow recession we are in will turn into a real one, if not a depression, if any unknown bubbles pop.   I think there is one festering in our university system that could pop.

> I think talking about things like reparations is extremely important, and unfortunately so toxic to some of the country that it'll never get its due.

It's not important or practical.  You can recognize that black americans have suffered at the hands of system oppresion while also simultaneously recognizing that there is no good or even remotely reasonable way to implement that, just like there is no way to repay college debt in a fair and equitable way.  I'm sorry but I do not have the inclination to debate this with you.  It should be an obvious truth to anyone that has spent more than 5 minutes brainstorming on either subject.  The GOP REJOICES every time democrats talk about reparations especially.  It only hurts them and there is this continuing beliefe from the pre-internet days that each party can pander to their respective sides during primaries and then swing messaging back to center for general elections.  I believe this is a myth and a greatly misunderstood thing.  I don't think it works like this anymore as a result of the changes over the last 15 years or so to online media and the ""conversation"" online, which holds them all accountable to every single syllable uttered at any time.

> I spend a lot of time in northern europe, so the student debt thing is a no brainer to me.

It's not though.  You are looking at it through the lens of what(?), a scandanavian country where 90%+ of the population are the same race, culture, etc... ?  Where you don't have 50 states that are basically autonomous nations with a loose alliance to their federal government?    The mormons in Utah might as well be their own country, same could be said of Californians, and Alaskans, and Texans, and people in the gulf coast states.

Direct comparisons between nations in north europe and the united states demonstrates you may be ignoring many differences, legally, culturally, geographical separation, etc...  The US is not the same as the rest of the world.  It really isn't. 

Personally, I'm really anxious about investing large sums of money into traditional education when we have the technology to make all of it basically 100% free but the university's are coveting this resource and preventing that from happening intentionally.  They are bad faith actors and are the absolute last people we should be throwing giant sums of money at to ""fix"" education.  More like throwing gasoline on a fire.  Fuck. THAT.   We need a massive overhaul of our public and university level education to be more online and more accessible to the average person.  It's blatant financial classism done in a predatory fashion and I blame all of the colleges.  ALL OF THEM.  It's a toxic culture.

Personally, I think the liberals should give up on the environment.  It's one of the issues most important to me but they should realize that although the US is a large voice on the world stage it is only 5% of the world population, and doesn't necessarily have to be a leader on that front.  Europe can do that.  China can help maybe.

We aren't talking about ground troops. The reason why the US would completely obliterate Iran is due to the technological superiority. The Iraq military was wiped off the face of the earth due to bombing. The only ground troops were to mop up the devastation. 

> Building it back? You think the US has any intention of doing that? They are doing a great job in Iraq, right? 

The reason why the US has sunk billions into reconstruction is to promote a government that will be less prone to radical nature and thus avoid a second war. 

Iran is a barbaric nation. That's not even controversial. They treat women as little more than slaves. Promote government mandated public executions of apostates and homosexuals. The sad part is that they once were a thriving people who valued freedom and equality. They have been taken over by Islamic radicals and are the personification of barbarism and violence. One of the Iranian government's publicly voiced objectives is to obliterate Israel and create a Jewish genocide comparable to nazi germany. And you defend them and say that the US is worse?

4. He supports Israel...ok, I believe the US has been an Israeli ally since 1948.

5. The “Fake News” has been a huge issue. Remember when CNN all but said he was done because of collusion? Hmm... he’s still in office.

6. Ivanka isn’t the president. It is fair to criticize the sweatshops. That doesn’t make Trump/Trump supporters hateful, racist, bigots. It’s indicative of issues with several American companies (and the people should totally speak out against that).

7.  It was a $20k portrait according to the Washington Post. I don’t think him using his own Foundation to buy a painting during a charity auction is that egregious. Smarmy, sure...but absolute human garbage? I don’t think so. I think it’s mild compared to most other politicians.

8. Yawn at the birther issue. I don’t even know how anyone can care about that all these years later. Trump wasn’t the first person who started talking about it. It was an issue during the first Hillary Clinton campaign (by some passionate supporters, not Hillary’s people).  This was the first example of Trump saying what so many conservatives were wondering. I think it was important because many “southern rednecks” and others were concerned about his time overseas, especially in Pakistan. It brought up legit concerns from voters who were less educated on the issue. He also admitted he was wrong (finally), so I am not convinced it means he’s totally “garbage.” He’s far from perfect, but he is not a racist person full of “hate” for specific groups."	c555x4	2019-06-27 07:20:40

How isn't it obvious? Using a word as an insult outside of the originally intended use is what gave the word a negative connotation. That's why people began finding it problematic. That was what I thought your point was. I was making that explicit. 

It wasn't very long ago that people used ""retarded"" to refer to mentally handicapped people by default. If someone uses it as a medical term you should consider it dated, not get offended. You should take intent into consideration.

I'm fully aware of the history of the word, and of the word idiot, and of the word dumb, and of the word imbecile and mongoloid etc. I don't use the word ""retarded"" to describe anyone. You should be less condescending.

In my day growing up was when the word 'special' was first being used as a way to emphasize different didn't mean beneath the rest.

These threads made me realize that a lot of people (myself included) don't realize how complicated international politics are and especially espionage.

In the mind of Trump's administration, drones are the same as human spies that were used constantly in cities all across the globe.

We spy a lot and are spied on a considerable amount, these drones are high up and not easy to detect. The FAA controls so much air space (I build copters and work aerospace) that it's very challenging to legally fly any hobby craft, which I imagine has some militaristic purpose.

The Soviet was the biggest supporter of Iraq in the last couple of years of the war, as they were worried about not only growing US presence, but how the end of the Iran/Iraq war would influence the situation in Afghanistan.

As for the drone, Iran was in their rights to shoot it down if it even temporarily entered their airspace. Although Iran presented GPS coordinates showing the drone 8 miles from the coast and inside their airspace. Also, even if it was outside of it, Iran have the right to demand identification and shoot a drone done if identification isn't given. If a drone entered the US Air defence identification zones (not their airspace) they'd get shot down. The drone didn't respond to several radio warnings and then got shot down. It was an act of provokation on behalf of the US. And no one should be surprised because they've done this kind of thing before. 

Saudi sponsored terrorists are the bad guys, they are the enemy of the US. And weapons will be sold to them so they can further arm them and further their murder of Yemenese.

I agree that media coverage of these crimes is often sensationalized.

It used to be the UK, now it's the US, and seeminly if everyone on /r/worldnews has their way it'll soon be China. What a world that'll be. I can't wait!

I don't think the US has enough seperation of powers either. I'd love it if Congress overturned the AUMF, or if the SCOTUS ruled it unconstitutional. Regardless, the checks we do have have worked well against Trump. His blanket muslim ban was overturned, the investigation into alleged ties between Trump and Russia netted millions in unpaid taxes, and several convictions for people who lied to the FBI or conspired against the US. Yes, Trump does get away with a lot as President. That's because only Congress has the power to indict a sitting President, and even though Democrats control the House (who would formally charge the President with a crime) they're not sure whether or not they should focus their energy there, or focus it on simply defeating Trump in 2020. I'm not sure which is better either, but I lean towards just voting him out of office. The American people made this mistake, and we should be the ones to fix it.

What ""abject horrors"" has Trump comitted? The man is a racist, sexist con-artist, but I dont think anything he's done reaches the level of ""abject horror"". Seems like he's more polarizing to non-Americans because he says a lot of things that need to be said, like how America essentially subsidizes the cost of Europe's military and not enough NATO members pay their fair share of the alliance.

> SAVAK (Persian: ساواک‎, short for سازمان اطلاعات و امنیت کشور Sāzemān-e Ettelā'āt va Amniyat-e Keshvar, literally ""Organization of National Intelligence and Security of the Nation"") was the secret police, domestic security and intelligence service in Iran during the reign of the Pahlavi dynasty. It was established by Mohammad Reza Shah with the help of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)[2] and the Israeli MOSSAD[3]. SAVAK operated from 1957 until the Iranian Revolution of 1979, when the prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar ordered its dissolution during the outbreak of Iranian Revolution. SAVAK has been described as Iran's ""most hated and feared institution"" prior to the revolution of 1979 because of its practice of torturing and executing opponents of the Pahlavi regime.[4][5] At its peak, the organization had as many as 60,000 agents serving in its ranks according to one source,[6] and another source by Gholam Reza Afkhami estimates SAVAK staffing at between 4,000 and 6,000.[7]

...

> Writing at the time of the Shah's overthrow, Time magazine on February 19, 1979, described SAVAK as having ""long been Iran's most hated and feared institution"" which had ""tortured and murdered thousands of the Shah's opponents.""[26] The Federation of American Scientists also found it guilty of ""the torture and execution of thousands of political prisoners"" and symbolizing ""the Shah's rule from 1963–79.""

You do realize many of the countries that are ""mismanaged"" as you call them have been actively influenced and at times invaded by US troops and paramilitary parties over the years? That the US is a major contributor to their instability and placement of criminals in office? I'm not saying we can pin down exactly how much of who to blame for what, but to say the US isn't in part to blame for the current crisis is just sticking our fingers in our ears. We caused a big part of that instability, so it's not right to say the home countries are the sole reason why their citizens are seeing such mass immigration (also, side note: asylum seeking immigrants aren't illegal). Seeing it as a crisis we in part caused makes it look even worse when we treat these asylum seekers inhumanely or deny them all together. It's just wrong all around, and NOT what many other freedom supporting countries do in similar situations. One need only to look to Germany or France (to some extent) to see how such situations should be handled.

&#x200B;

I would imagine if you are in banking this is a true statement.  I'm also doing well for myself so I don't have personal complaints.  I want to see wage growth and I want to stop needing to subsidize walmart employees, and similar occupations.  I also think we're on the brink of a burst, but I'm no econ major either. 

> It's not important or practical. You can recognize that black americans have suffered at the hands of system oppresion while also simultaneously recognizing that there is no good or even remotely reasonable way to implement that, just like there is no way to repay college debt in a fair and equitable way. I'm sorry but I do not have the inclination to debate this with you. It should be an obvious truth to anyone that has spent more than 5 minutes brainstorming on either subject. The GOP REJOICES every time democrats talk about reparations especially. It only hurts them and there is this continuing beliefe from the pre-internet days that each party can pander to their respective sides during primaries and then swing messaging back to center for general elections. I believe this is a myth and a greatly misunderstood thing. I don't think it works like this anymore as a result of the changes over the last 15 years or so to online media and the ""conversation"" online, which holds them all accountable to every single syllable uttered at any time. 

&#x200B;

Agree to disagree then.  I don't need to debate reparations either.  There are many other issues that can be fixed in the black community before talking about that.   

 I do agree that dems hurt themselves by bringing it up.  But not bringing an issue up bc it hurts you in the polls is not a very good reason.  But it's very clear that Dems have been beat in elections on every level for decades because they cannot stay on message like the GOP can.  That's their biggest problem, and it's a tough one to fix bc they are a very diverse party which causes a lot of fighting inside itself.  The GOP is relentless at staying on point.  Not sure that it's good for the country, but it's def good for the party.  

&#x200B;

To your last point;  I don't know what needs to be done, but my point stands that we cannot allow an entire generation of children to enter the workforce with this crazy amount of dept.  Life is not fair, and we're not going to find a fair solution.  I worked for years to pay off my student debt, and I'm not quite done yet (in the final stretch though!).  So if all student debt is forgiven next year, that's not going to be fair to me.  But I know it will help this country immensely.  

&#x200B;

Just so you know, my own political beliefs and ideas are built on the fact that there is a ton of money available to work with, but it's not being well spent.  I also think that the very richest of us all need to be paying their fair share, and companies that enjoy the protections and freedom that they do in the US, need to pay taxes on the money they make here like the rest of us.  I think that we can solve our problems without raising taxes on you and I.

Iran, Britain, Germany, France, China, Russia, the US, and the EU signed an **international agreement** for the prevention of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, where Iran fulfilled all of its obligations as independently verified by both the USA and the UN, and then the USA then unilaterally broke this **agreement** and applied sanctions on Iran anyway despite it keeping up its end of the **international agreement**, while at the same time supporting a murderous regime with a worse human rights and military policy both militarily and financially, in exactly the same region.

There, I said agreement not treaty.  Can I be not an Iranian bot now?

Now, ignoring the semantics of ""treaty"" vs ""agreement"" or ""deal"" in relation to the JCPOA, how about the actual point that certain individuals in the US administration have a pre-packaged (and, incidentally, insane) puppet government ready to impose on the Iranian people, and that they keep applying economic blockades on Iran specifically designed to starve the civilian population of enough resources that enough civilians die from the consequences of poverty that the government collapses (and allows the US to go in to ""help""), or to provoke rogue elements in the national guard or indeed any Iranian into to doing something retaliatory enough that gives the US a pretext for war?  And that even when the alleged reason behind waging economic war on Iran was removed (Iran working to get a nuke), they went right back to waging economic war on the Iranian civilian population anyway because they're dying to wage actual war in Iran and install a puppet state for their own self-interest."	c555x4	2019-06-26 01:02:47

>The office of the supreme leader is more powerful than the office of the president. The supreme leader is responsible for appointing senior officials in the military, judiciary, and the civil government.

>As supreme leader, Khamenei has constitutional authority over the judiciary, the regular armed forces and the elite Revolutionary Guards, and the state-controlled media. He also has effective control over powerful institutions, such as the 12-member Guardian Council, which has the authority to vet electoral candidates and veto parliamentary decisions. (Khamenei appoints half its members, as well as the judicial chief who appoints the other half.) The Iranian economy is largely state-controlled, and Khamenei has discretionary authority over how the country’s oil revenue is spent. He also oversees the country’s bonyads—charitable foundations with billions of dollars in assets—in addition to the millions more his office receives in charitable donations offered to Iran’s holy shrines.

If Iran sees that there is actually a positive to changing its behaviour it will. But right now, it sees that its behaviour is not the issue. Its the fact it opposes the US geopolitically. The US will always find an excuse to punish Iran, so it will not change its course.

The nuclear deal proved that. They gave diplomacy a chance. They gave more than enough assurances that they were not developing nukes. More than any other country needs to. They knew it was a manufactured crisis from the start, but they tried to placate the US.

>In international relations, **sanctions are a tool that nations and nongovernmental agencies use to influence or to punish other nations or non-state actors.** Most sanctions are economic in nature, but they may also carry the threat of diplomatic or military consequences as well. Sanctions can be unilateral, meaning they are imposed only by one nation, or bilateral, meaning a bloc of nations (such as a trade group) is imposing the penalties.

I'm not a democrat. I'm not even American you hippocrite. Funny how it's fine when he does it but proving him wrong is a no go zone lol

You're such a transparent bullshitter.

And yes, the guy before him was also an idiot, but with all the support Roy moore got, and the protection republican actors provided Jeffrey Epstein, at least his idiocy has standing in recent politics. When Anthony Weiners scandal came out he was shunned.

I was going to call him out too but I cannot find any equivalent list. The ones I've found are comparatively tiny. It seems despite constantly accusing Dems of pedophilia for years republicans have been either unable or unwilling to create such a list"	c555x4	2019-06-26 03:23:43

So if all student debt is forgiven next year, that's not going to be fair to me. But I know it will help this country immensely. 

Different starting point doesn't mean that their net income over 25-30 years won't be twice that of those that didn't go to college.  I'm not listening to the upper 20% of the educated population cry over their loans.  Its' infantile.  Any redistribution of wealth should be focused on the lower 30%, otherwise you're just re-branding trickle down economics to a different class.  You proving that you and others have a hardship doesn't prove priority or relative importance to the rest of the population.

> Just so you know, my own political beliefs and ideas are built on the fact that there is a ton of money available to work with, but it's not being well spent. I also think that the very richest of us all need to be paying their fair share, and companies that enjoy the protections and freedom that they do in the US, need to pay taxes on the money they make here like the rest of us. I think that we can solve our problems without raising taxes on you and I.

I kinda used to be you.  The magic money tree isn't real.  The boogeymen aren't real.  The politicians are a reflection of the voters.  You have to stop having so much faith and hope in people if you want to see reality.  What really changed things for me was during the Obama/Romney election when I watched /r/politics change over night from being moderately libertarian to a precusor of what it is now.  Something clicked and I realized then that both sides were just the same, not really that different, the voters I mean, and that the upper class uses divisive issues, issues they themselves don't give AF about, like abortion, guns, privacy, race, sex, sexuality, etc... they don't give AF.

If people were calling me out on being Asian/Sri Lankan in public in an attempt to make me out to be an outsider, then I think the *wrong* response would be to reject my identity. Rejecting my identity validates their beliefs that Asians and Sri Lankans can't be Americans. That's not how this country works; I'm not going to be a closeted Asian.

I would liken that to how gay people were treated in the 90s. ""Gay"" was used as an insult (""That's so gay""). Gay people had to hide their identity; they couldn't get married; they couldn't enjoy the same rights as non-gay people. Specifically, in the military, the rampant homophobia lead to a system called ""Don't ask, don't tell"" where the government wouldn't ask service members about their sexuality, but if they found out someone was gay through other means, that person would be discharged. This was an *incredibly* unpopular idea, and there was much celebration when that was finally done away with.

So now, if someone were trying to make me to be an outsider by calling me Asian, where does it stop? I very clearly look South Asian, so if we give credence to the idea that Asians aren't American, then some people might look at me and say ""Hey, he's Asian, he's not American!"" and won't treat me right, no matter how many times I say ""No, no, I'm not Asian, I'm *American!""* Maybe my freedoms will gradually erode away, from not being able to serve in the military (like the gays) to being thrown into interment camps (like the Japanese).

We need to live in an America where ethnicity isn't ignored but is *embraced*. Barack Obama is half Kenyan-American. I'm Sri Lankan-American. Anyone who has a problem with that needs to get over it, because this is America, and there's going to be a lot more of us, coming from lots of different backgrounds, all acting, walking, talking and overall *looking* different than everyone else. That all needs to be embraces.

1. Separating families and letting children die is ok if they were trying to escape gang violence and guns that came in the mainly from the USA. (Mexico has ONE gun store and it's not busy)

2. Poor communities don't need access to the internet, clean water, social systems when a child's parent fails them.

3. Military parades are very legal and very cool

4. Saudis Arabia can do whatever it likes as long as they have that sweet oil and invest in trump hotels and properties.

5. IT'S NOT WRONG TO ALLOW FOREIGN INFLUENCERS TO PAY YOU LSTGE SUMS OF MONEY TO STAY AT YOUR HOTEL WHILE YOU'RE PRESIDENT.

6. Golfing more than working after eviscerating Obama for how much he golfed is OK

The Shah ignored the Constitution and Iran's Parliament had been reduced to a rubber stamp. There was only one political party allowed which was controlled by the Shah.

Today, Iran is indeed an Islamic Republic, and one in which people regularly vote and participate in, Iran has hotly-fought elections in which non-favored candidates have frequently won office, and whatever its limitations people turn-out to vote at high rates.

Did you not even read my post, i explained how bad the life was under Shah and how it improved after he left? Stop acting as the life under Shah where better, come with sources instead.

The regime under the Shah was a repressive dictatorship that was twice overthrown by the same people who installed this new regime in power in a bloody revolution, which has also massively improved people's living standards. So there's a bunch of differences.

&#x200B;

He was a ruthless dictator, and he used a Stasi-style secret police called [SAVAK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK) to arrest, torture, or execute anyone he saw as a threat. Read about SAVAK a little, i will quote a little for you.

&#x200B;

"" nail extractions; snakes (favored for use with women); electrical shocks with cattle prods, often into the rectum; cigarette burns; sitting on hot grills; acid dripped into nostrils; near-drownings; mock executions; and an electric chair with a large metal mask to muffle screams while amplifying them for the victim. This latter contraption was dubbed the Apollo—an allusion to the American space capsules.

&#x200B;

The FAS list of SAVAK torture methods included ""electric shock, whipping, beating, inserting broken glass and pouring boiling water into the rectum, tying weights to the testicles, and the extraction of teeth and nails.""[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK#cite_note-27)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK#cite_note-28)"""	c555x4	2019-06-25 20:44:35

But let's be honest here I've seen the state of American supply. Most of the money for our military goes into tanks, and planes that are never used you see, and we don't have the crews to man them. Because the factories that produce these weapons are very profitable to certain people. Meanwhile the infantry are lucky if they get a decent kevlar vest.

So the process is you have 72 hours max to be in a holding cell then you are moved to a reassignment facility where you are processed. Trump's admin stopped that secod part which created a backlog at the part where people are only supposed to be for 72 hours. Hence the self created crisis.

8371	1561503950.0	"Your argument is disingenuous because you know that no one is volunteering to be thrown in concentration camps.

They may be voluntarily entering the country illegally (assuming they are not seeking asylum, which is not illegal), but the punishment that US is currently using for this is cruel & unusual. The punishment ""illegal immigrants"" are receiving is itself more criminal than the act they're being punished for. They should not have to *expect* for their flight to freedom to result in their human rights being violated. And just to be clear, I think that illegal border crossing is a problem that needs a solution; this isn't even close to it. 

Allowing people to be deported back to an unsafe country where they are likely to die, or have their human rights violated, or are economically prejudices, etc etc is a pretty weak. 

>As a half Pole half Jew, you are belittling the greatest tragedy to even have been faced by my people.

Shady tactic, but in fact it's you who's doing that by refusing to admit and act as we enter a time where history *could* repeat itself. I'm not saying it's that bad yet, but we can't wait until then.

Your logic ""just don't jump the border"" is insulting reductive, and someone could easily just say ""jewish people should have just left their homes before the germans could drag them out"". Which, of course... many did. They came to North America as refugees, many of which were sent back... and died. So please, stop belittling the suffering of people."	c555x4	2019-06-26 01:05:50

Swearing isn't illegal, swear away. Its fun.

Calling you a name while also responding to what you said is by definition not an ad hominem. Its just being a dick

That said after posting I realized you didn't deserve the vitriol really so I apologize for that.

Again, I'm not defending democrats, I don't particularly like the party as a whole. But having spent a while since my comment lookin into it, while I find systemic issues with the party, I cannot find evidence its on the same scope or scale. Both parties seem to half similar rates of criminality in national Congress, I cannot find evidence there is the same degree pedophilia.

Also interesting is the fact that since nixon republicans have had over 100 indictments within the white house administration while democrats are closer to 3.

What I really want to know, and I hope to research it this week, is how the rates of pedophilia not only break down by party but by state algignment. For example, are republicans more likely to be pedophiles if they work in a blue state, or democrats when in a red state.

The other thing that strikes me is democrats are more likely, at least in recent years, to shun their own. Weiner obviously got thrown in the bin. Franklin resigned over what was almost certainly a lie(the e
""Evidence"" was a perspective camera trick and iirc the accuser was known for sexually harrssing people, and a conservative operatives. I might be confusing her with someone else but at the time I didn't consider it credible, and not because Franklin's a democrat her story just didn't add up. I'm not in the ""there's no way a woman would make a false accusation"" camp""). Meanwhile Roy Moore is about to try and run again and recieved a lot of support from trump last time, probably this time too.

But that list I provided is huge.

I've tried really hard to find an equivalent but I cannot. Combined, assuming none of them shared perpetrators, the democratic lists Ive seen come to about 1/3 that number, if even"	c555x4	2019-06-26 05:00:45

As far as being privy to what stocks are sold, obviously we will not get that being as it’s the service they provide. (Vanguard or other retirement funds) in speaking with what type of investments, the second trump was elected, I switched to risky investment for better return. If this guy has all his money (if any lol) in bonds, he probably saw a smaller gain but even still, his gains would be substantial. All in all, he’s clearly a shit investor being that he has either no money in his 401k (wouldn’t surprise me as most liberals don’t have jobs lol kidding relax) or has no idea how the exchanges work.	c555x4	2019-06-26 08:33:07

So it is not a real democracy at all.  They hang people from cranes for being gay, leaving Islam, criticizing the government, etc... They support terrorism, they have tried to assassinate people in places like France just recently.  They want to literally genocide the citizens of Israel.  Their own population has had two seperate mass uprisings in the last decade, but sadly they failed to dislodge the power structure there.

I cannot fathom how you could support such an awful regime and make completely ignorant statements like Iran is a better country than the US.

Let me know when antifa starts pretending to be border patrol agents, or threatening police lives by forming a Militia to defend an elected official from doing their job. 

Or going on mass shootings at an increasing rate while the person in the highest political position in their party defends the actions of Nazis and calls for war criminals who slaughtered villages of innocents to be pardoned

I dont have a perfect solution, but if they must be kept in detainment then they shouldn't be split from their families and should have human rights respected.

>What happens if you take your kid with you to rob a bank? Do they put you both in the same jail cell?

No, they wouldnt put the kid in a jail cell at all... but you're arguing they should. nice.
Illegal border crossing and robbing a bank are not similar crimes at all, so the comparing isnt in good faith really. Answering this question anyway would lead to the ultimate question of whether jail cells are moral or effective forms of justice anyway. 

>A good percentage of these kids are taken by people who are not their parents and trafficked across the border. Young girls are given birth control because their chances of getting raped when making the journey is so high.

This is distinctly different than the reality that people are criticizing; people aren't just being detained but being kept in inadequate conditions and causing unnecessary suffering. 

>well know you will be detained, people still show up.

Because they don't expect USA to put them in **concentration camps**. They have this really stupid idea that USA is a country that values freedom. 

> the Nazis shouldn't have invaded other countries.

That's putting it mildly. They should have done a lot less than just stopping there.

>No one is putting a gun to the heads of the migrants and sayong ""go to the american concentration camp"". 

No, instead they're saying ""either go home where you are sure to suffer, or suffer as a prisoner here"". It's not a great choice, and maybe you're OK sending people back to certain death (as happened to the jewish refugees who tried claim asylum and were denied), but I'm not as quick to make that call.

>Those people believe that an unborn fetus is a child, the same as a toddler walking down the street. That means, for them, they are doing the right thing.

That, in my opinion, is a perfectly defensible philosophical position. Philosophers much, much smarter than you or I defend it. So to pretend this is some simple question of ""women's rights"" its absurdly anti-intellectual. Women don't have a right to murder babies - and that is *exactly* what those people think abortion is. I don't agree with them myself, but that's not the point. *Your opinion on this topic is not a universal truth.* 

>Destroying our countries foreign relations, enacting harmful environmental policies, enacting idiotic tariffs to hurt American farms and businesses is just a small part of the laundry list of nonsensical actions this administration has done or tried to do.

I don't agree that a single one of those things you just said, apart from from enacting harmful environmental policies, are even true. **But that is completely besides the point..** Some people probably think Trump's foreign policy is absolutely perfect. Some people probably think his sanctions/tariffs etc are going to have a beneficial result. Are they wrong? Maybe. But, again, that's completely besides the point.

I concur that America is starting to decline. I think anyone who denies that is naive. My point is simply that list doesn't reflect every element of every day life. Regardless of who concocted that list, it was done so based on a specific set of standards. Not all standards. For example, in this case size matters. America is much larger and has way more people than a lot of those countries on the list.

Shah was a ruthless dictator, and he used a Stasi-style secret police called [SAVAK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK) to arrest, torture, or execute anyone he saw as a threat. Read about SAVAK a little, i will quote a little for you.

"" nail extractions; snakes (favored for use with women); electrical shocks with cattle prods, often into the rectum; cigarette burns; sitting on hot grills; acid dripped into nostrils; near-drownings; mock executions; and an electric chair with a large metal mask to muffle screams while amplifying them for the victim. This latter contraption was dubbed the Apollo—an allusion to the American space capsules.

The FAS list of SAVAK torture methods included ""electric shock, whipping, beating, inserting broken glass and pouring boiling water into the rectum, tying weights to the testicles, and the extraction of teeth and nails.""[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK#cite_note-27)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK#cite_note-28)"""	c555x4	2019-06-25 23:38:32

Its interesting no such list exists though. If you're going to claim both sides are the same, and this is a secret don't tell anyone, your feelings don't matter. Numbers do.

Similarly the republican party *loves* the Hastert rule which is a violation of constitutional duty

I cannot find a single reference to this, please provide proof and I'll change my mind. I don't mind being wrong about him. If he's a predator then he's a predator. I don't mind saying I was wrong to you. But I cannot find what you are talking about on the first 2 pages of Google.

In fact I don't mind being wrong about anything I've said. Especially since none of it was my point, its anal argument that's extended into this. My original point was this constant ""hurr democrats are synonymous with pedos you should be conservative"" shit is clearly and objectively wrong. So is the other way around despite how I may come across here. As I said, the guy saying repubs love voting for pedos is equally as shit. Though, and again I'm bias, the issue does seem to show up more in republican convictions than democrat. 

All of which is why I have repeatedly asked for proof. I appreciate what you e provided thiugh

>Yeah unfortunately you need actual evidence to label people as evil and oust them from your ran

No, you don't, at all. Just like conservatives are convinced Hillary is a criminal despite no conviction against her. The standard of proof in a court is rightfully insanely higher than you as a voter. Moore is credibly accused, he was banned from a mall for harrssing teenage girls.

>Concrete, admissible evidence wasn’t present in the Trump

He was accused under oath which was rescinded as part of a settlement. 

He was also accused in the Epstein case which I hope you agree was an abortion of justice 

>Moore

He's literally admitted to chasing teenage year old girls. He met his wife at a high school dance iirc. He was banned from a mall decades ago for similar accusations. 

Kavanaughs an interesting one. I find fordes testimony believable I think it's probably ""true"", with muddied details and a memory of regret and shame with some unintended edits. I think he's probably not evil or even really a rapist (I think he was just a young idiot, and I believe he absolutely perjured himself by lying about terms like boofing), and his Scotus tenure has been surprisingly solid.
As an aside I think gorsuch is a partisan, corporatist, activist hack but Kavanaugh, despite some comments of his in the past, has impressed me.


When Sanders was under investigation democrats including himself welcomed it and he came out innocent. 

Franklin publically insisted on an ethics investigation.

Contrast that to how Trump handled his, per the Mueller report he repeatedly obstructed justice, the refusal of republicans to look into the Moore issue and the absolutely comical ""investigation"" into kavanaugh. If any of them allowed the justice system to properly exonerate them, they wouldn't have the shadow of illegitimacy they have. 

There are fundemental differences between how the parties(voters especially) approach these issues.

You mention innocent until proven guilty. The number of times I've seen that line used incorrectly by conversatives here is infuriating. Repeatedly seeing ""what proof is there to justify an investigation"" as if proof leads to investigation and not the other way around. 

Lastly, the progressive wing if the democrats is especially enthusiastic about justice, sometimes a sick sense of it(as you said, innocent until proven guilty) but they turn on their own quickly. There are no such conervative movements gatekeeping the integrity of their party (again, aknowledging that that the progressive take on integrity is at times a little sick an overzealous, the underlying movement comes from a just place)"	c555x4	2019-06-26 06:22:47

Actually no it wasn’t forwarded to the police, they couldn’t investigate it due to “conflict of interest” with Ellison being on the Minneapolis city council. You know who could have investigated it?

And even the simplest thing you did mention, you can’t even understand. And you’re telling me I have no argument?

Ok, let me break it down into simple terms.

Fully employed = good

Underemployed = bad, but still counts as employed.

If 96.5% (100% - 3.5% unemployment) of the labor pool is all fully employed, that’s a great thing. In this case, 3.5% unemployment is fucking phenomenal.

If that 96.5% of employed labor pool is all underemployed working 10 hours a week, unemployment is still 3.5%, but it’s not good at all, because people can’t live off 10 hours worth of min wage income. In fact, in this case, the unemployment figure is a completely meaningless measure.

So, I have a very simple question for you. Forget the other questions I’ve asked which you are obviously incapable of answering. It’s ok that you can’t. I took me a decade of schooling to be able to. Just recognize that you’ve dodged every single challenged I’ve put in front of you. 

So just the simple question, *my dude*:

Of the 96.5% that have a job, how many are fully employed, and how many are underemployed? And how does this split today compare to the same split 2 years ago? 5 years ago? 10? 15?

Keep on mindlessly worshiping Trump."	c555x4	2019-06-26 01:15:29

yeah his dad money gave him. somehow when his dad was worth at a peak of 250 million in 1999, he magically became a multi-billionaire. I mean he must have inherited -2,700 million right? there's no other explanation according to your delusion.

>the fact he didn't write 

He did, and having ghostwriters doesn't diminish his idea or thoughts that went into his publications/best sellers

> failed businesses

Failing a few times isn't a measure of success, I can point to times when Jeff Bezos (zshops)  and other great Entrepreneurs failed. You don't measure success from a few failures, you measure success at the conclusion of these failures, and trump's conclusion is accumulating 3.5b in net worth. Sorry facts upset you cowboy.

>why threaten his old school to reveal his marks?

under FERPA, disclosing academic records without the student’s written permission is illegal.

Nice quote, you can spam it 100 times, it will never defeat the lifetime of awards, success, and merit trump has accumulated.

Thanks for putting yourself checkmate.

If Trump had good grades, he would give permission to publish them to brag about it. Since he doesn't allow it, the opposite is true.

You just ignored his merit/awards/and success lmao.

Where's the proof he's denied the medical usage of vaccinations?

Is this one of your 2-scoops news? alt-news to find any reason to be anti-trump? TDS is strong with you.

I give a counter argument.

However, you are unable to provide ANY evidence of my counter not being valid. Meaning that your claim of it being invalid is meaningless.

So either back up your statement that my counter isn't valid, or admit you're wrong.

Source? 

Can you give quantifiable evidence of an item being in front of you? No you can't. You can't express that in numbers or measure it in numbers.

So you're saying it's impossible to prove that an item stands in front of you, since according to you quantifiable evidence is the only valid type of evidence.
