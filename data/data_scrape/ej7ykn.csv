39	1578052935.0	I'm having trouble thinking of a single American equivalent to Soleimani. The best I can come up with is that he's sort of the equivalent as to if the head of our CIA and SOCOM were one guy, who was also somewhat revered publicly. Is this at all accurate?

Edit: He began working with Iran's Revolutionary Guard in Kuwait in 1983, organizing attacks on embassies of countries that supported Saddam in the Iran–Iraq War.[1] Hours after the December 1983 bomb attacks on U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait, he fled to Iran.[3] He was later convicted and sentenced to death in absentia by a court in Kuwait for planning the attacks.[4] He settled in Iran, married an Iranian woman, and became an Iranian citizen.

Them targeting and plotting against US contractors, is however, a new phenomena. The blame unfortunately partly due to the US, which provoked these two men when it started launching strategic airstrikes on Iranian funded militia in Iraq. These strikes severely hampered Iran's efforts of building an army in Iraq that's mostly controlled by the Islamic nation. 

To give an example that's equivalent to this scenario, then I would liken it to a US' high-profile general meeting with a rebel general in Crimea. Only to have Russia bomb both of them to kingdom come. The whole thing is like opening your fridge in the morning only to find that you've just one plate of spaghetti that you cooked a couple of weeks ago.

If true then I think this is good news, as he’s done a lot of harm to the region, it’s peoples, our troops, and the troops of our allies, but he seems to have been a beloved family man judging by some stuff I’ve seen and I hope them and their country do well in the future.

I however greatly doubt this. There will without doubt be more blood shed over this but I don't think any country, correction, any G8 or ahem G9, county that will use this as their battle cry for all out war. Russia is powerful but has a shaky economy and despite their military's overall size, a great deal of it is antiquated. They rely way too much on energy exports to sustain the economy and would that would be heavily jeopardized if global war were to break out. China has been making huge strides over the last decade in terms of economy and military. That said, their economic growth has become stagnant and have infact seen negative growth over last two years. Despite their major military overhaul and technological advances, the US simply outspends China three fold and has done so for decades. 

The whole thing is scary sad but I don't think too many people can fully grasp the sheer enormity of the US's military might. Hell, even as a person like myself, who had worked with DoD for ten years, can hardly comprehend it. The US spends more on defense and military than the next seven countries combined (source below). As I stated earlier, I'm in no way a fan of war or the money spent on prepping or delivering, but I am a realist and can comfortably say ; There is no other country on Earth today that could possibly beat the US in a balls out military conflict. I'm not talking nuclear because in that scenario we're all fucked, but every other scenario... US comes out on top. The United States simply put, has way too much firepower to be fucked with. It's scary as hell but also very true.

> **The United States has not declared war since World War II,** yet frequently uses military force abroad, for the most part, because it is politically costly for both Congress and the president to formally acknowledge a war — despite the fact that the framers of the Constitution put the war power in the hands of Congress precisely to avoid this outcome. ^1

One of the biggest clusterfucks that has occurred in the US (especially since 9/11) is that Presidents have started using Executive Powers (Article II) citing “national security” to do pretty much whatever they want as Commander In Chief of the armed forces. Doing this sidesteps Congress and the need to “declare war”.  Again, we never declared war on Vietnam, we never declared war on Iraq... We just did it. So, effectively, there’s nothing to declare because they won’t declare it, but we’re already there.

> When the United States declared war on Japan after the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks, it signified one of the last times the country officially declared war.

> Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq: technically, those were not wars. Those conflicts, and other in between, are considered “Extended Military Engagements.” ^2

So, yeah... We’re already in this thing, y’all.

A version of this has been going on for over 5,000 years, and unless something *really big* happens the change the paradigm, it's going to keep going on like this. It's part of the culture.

If you want to understand the politics of the Middle East, you need to understand four things.

1) The old saying: Myself against my brother. Myself and my brother against my cousin. Myself, my brother, and my cousin against the world.

2) Friendship and enmity are ephemeral. If it benefits you, the ally of today will be the foe of tomorrow, and the other way around.

3) As long as the United States is a strong ally of either Sunni Saudi Arabia or Jewish Israel, we will be an enemy of a theocratic Shia Iran.

4) As long as the world uses oil, the United States will kick the shit out of anyone who poses an existential threat to Saudi Arabia or the Saudi ruling party. In return, Saudi Arabia sells oil in US dollars and maintains the petro-dollar system.

Periodic fighting between the US and Iran will continue until either Iran adopts a secular government or the petrodollar system collapses.

Obama hoped to try a different path, turn the other cheek, and discarded the above wisdom. Unfortunately it didn't work.

If you genuinely believe the Iranian military poses any genuine threat to the US military, you're out of touch with reality. They will be curb stomped within a week. 

To be perfectly honest they have been getting away with shit for decades that has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of millions of people by now. The forces we've been fighting against in the Middle East for the past two decades have been largely funded by Iran anyway. With Iran's interference the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have lasted many years longer than they should have because of Iran's ability to funnel resources to the insurgents, not to mention they've been orchestrating the insurgent groups the entire time.

So basically, we've been at war with Iran for 2 decades already. They were just using insurgent groups as their proxies. So it's honestly high time we took the fight directly to them. 

You want to kill the hydra you have to kill all the heads. And Iran is all the heads. All these various terrorist groups would crumble if Iran was no longer funding them. It's very hard to fight a war if you don't have any money to purchase supplies, and all the large supply caches in Iran would be air striked before a single tank rolls across the border. Their entire communications network would be dismantled, too.

And not a single one of their ""allies"" is going to jump into the fight to save them. Any nation moronic enough to even send troops to defend Iran will pull their shit out within the first day or two after witnessing the surgical precision that Iran's military gets decimated before any land troops actually deploy. There isn't going to be a ""World War 3"" over this. Nobody is going to actually risk their neck for Iran against the full force of the US military, which Iran has never actually had any direct battles against since they used terrorist groups as proxies.

The world will be a tremendously better place without Ali Khamenei sitting on top of so much wealth, funding a crazy religious war against everybody else while terrorizing his own citizens. Diplomacy has repeatedly failed with them for 2 decades, and I honestly think it might be a good idea for some other countries to get a reminder of what exactly the US military is capable of doing in a conventional war where our soldiers aren't expected to try to be peacekeepers and help rebuild a country, a task no military is good at doing and was never going to work so long as Iran kept interfering and sabotaging everything we tried to do to help the Iraqi and Afghanistan people.

196	1578074943.0	Wtf is wrong with all these news outlets. The media keeps writing him off as a terrorist, but the man was the most popular general in iran, and has served in every major conflict since the iran-iraq war of the 80s. Those militias we drone striked the other day were the paramilitary units that both provoked (via brutality against sunnis) and ultimately crushed isis. Bin laden was a freaking terrorist. We just murdered the general of a sovereign state just because we could. Under the same reasoning the iranians (if they had the ability), could simply call Bush, Obama, Trump or Petraeus terrorists for killing civilians in drone strikes. The news media is pushing the terrorist narrative hard to justify state sanctioned assassinations of foreign leaders. It's disgusting how we're being led to think this is a good thing. Have no question about it - the United States is the aggressor here. We invaded a neighboring country, allowed the worlds most dangerous terrorist organization to take over half of Iraq, negotiated then immediately reneged on our nuclear treaty obligations, killed a foreign general over non lethal non violent protests. I'm not even mentioning the shah, the shooting down of an Iranian airliner or the 1950s coup detat. On top of that we are fucking allies with Mister Bonesaw Saudi Arabia which sponsors almost all of the actual fucking terrorism. The media somehow wants us to think that the average Iranian hates the Iranian government more than they would hate the United States after all this bullshit. We should be in the streets protesting this action	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 19:09:03
197	1578067210.0	This is the biggest and sadly most destructive event that has happened for US-Iran relations since the hostage crisis in 1979 superseding the US shooting down a civilian Iranian airplane. For better or worse, Soleimani was causal in the defeat of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and for this alone he was revered in the Middle East even by those who were  opposed to the Iranian regime. This will likely be a big turning point in the region. I wishfully pray for a resolution without casualties.	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 17:00:10

1. The U.S. completely destabilized Iran and ruined its DEMOCRATIC government in 1953, resulting in the current administration.
2. The U.S. invaded, further destabilized, and ruined Iraq under false pretenses, killing thousands of innocents along the way.
3. The U.S. is allies with and sells arms to Saudi Arabia, who ACTUALLY fund terrorism and are perhaps the most detrimental and backwards country in the Middle East.

Looking at these three FACTS, how is the U.S. not majorly at fault for the rise of people like Soleimani? How is the U.S. not responsible for the continued destabilization of the region? Why are you so eager to start ANOTHER war or wipe a country off the map, when your country actually orchestrated all of this?

This comes across as poorly thought out, with no coherent strategy in place to engage Iran in a manner that precludes military action without even attempting to engage Iran with any respect. Basically, it's just another example of disastrous foreign policy in action under the Trump administration.

Personally, I wouldn't mind if Iran drops a few cruise missiles on the WH and solves our biggest problem permanently: instead, I would imagine that we'll be shipping home some dead US soldiers for burial soon enough.

I wouldn't be surprised if Soleimani's location was passed to Trump with the request that he take him out, since if Israel did it there would be much larger consequences/retaliations.

There is a silver lining though. There were sayings that he was capable of making a military coupe and due to his iconic figure, he might actually succeed. He was also among the few capable commanders in the IRGC, others mostly being fat idiots. So, selling him out as a sacrificial lamb to US both for appeasement and to safeguard against a coupe is not a far fetched possibility IMO.

They would be obliterated just like Iraq’s government was within days of us invading their country. Also keep in mind we have troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, literally the two countries that surround Iran. They know we have a nearly fool-proof plan layed out for war if it comes to it and they don’t want to forcefully push us down said plan. This is why we felt so confident striking the way we did.

627	1578067156.0	"Something not many others are touching on, it's a matter of perspective.

From the point of Iran/the middle east/future geopolitical junk, this is monumental for a whole variety of reasons. How famous the person was, the fact he was actually a general not just some funded terrorist group leader, how close it was to an airport, etc.  The diplomatic damage alone this will do is practically impossible to appreciate, or really predict outside of most of Iran's population hating the fuck out of America.

From the perspective of, ""Is this the start of WW3/draft/heavy open conflict"" thing, probably not, or if it is it's a domino in a pretty long chain.  

Iran knows that open war with the US is basically asking for all their leadership to be killed, military annihilated, and infrastructure destroyed with god knows how many civilian casualties + the usual list of young soldiers who don't really have a choice.  No gain for anyone in power, and loss for everyone involved.  

The only way that changes is China/Russia or some other major power pulling the diplomatic equivalent of dropping their dick on the table and shouting all in.  Could happen in today's world, but on top of tons of other reasons like Iran being strategically important more than diplomatically important, oddly Turmp's failures make this less likely since while a previous president would hesitate at the consequences I think everyone would bet on Trump diving in.

So instead it's much more likely that Iran hits back in one of a myriad of other ways.  There's too many to go into in depth but the likely stuff is getting even closer with our enemies, be it nations or groups, and fucking us up in any way they can economically."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 16:59:16

As for Americans in Iraq dying form IEDs, they claim Iran was backing Iraqi rebels setting up IEDs. They've provided no evidence and fail to mention USA was the aggressor invading Iraq over non-existent WMDs, so of course one should expect locals to fight back.

635	1578089437.0	"I feel like the World War 3 comments are a bit drastic based on what happened but it’s certainly something to be concerned about now. Regardless of how you feel about Trump, here’s the skinny:

This guy was basically the second in command of Iran and super popular apparently (think the equivalent of the Vice President, Sec. of State, and the whole of our Joint Chiefs if Staff to understand the gravity). He was with the leader of the militia that attacked the US Embassy at the time of the attack, but this was also an attack that occurred without any council with members of Congress as is supposed to be the case.

At the very least, Iran has responded by saying this was an act of war and that their “official response” to this will be a strike of their own, so that’s the biggest concern at this point. I still personally believe that we aren’t going to see a World War like we have seen in the past, but this could realistically get pretty ugly in the near future if we see unhindered escalation."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 23:10:37

This is quite literally America attacking first and it wouldn't be unreasonable to call it an act of war. Iran cannot stand up to America alone though so unless Russia or China call this a red line it wouldn't end well to openly declare. 



The most likely outcome is an increase in Terrorism against the US and Key allies. The most likely outcome is collateral damage and civilian casualties.

Edit: To all the red hats, you seriously can't reason that Trump is this great leader when he can't even talk to the public about this event after it happened like Obama did.

>THE PRESIDENT:  Good evening.  Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who’s responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.

>It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history.  The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon; the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.

>And yet we know that the worst images are those that were unseen to the world.  The empty seat at the dinner table.  Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father.  Parents who would never know the feeling of their child’s embrace.  Nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us, leaving a gaping hole in our hearts.

>On September 11, 2001, in our time of grief, the American people came together.  We offered our neighbors a hand, and we offered the wounded our blood.  We reaffirmed our ties to each other, and our love of community and country.  On that day, no matter where we came from, what God we prayed to, or what race or ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family.

>We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice.  We quickly learned that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda -- an organization headed by Osama bin Laden, which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe.  And so we went to war against al Qaeda to protect our citizens, our friends, and our allies.

The US deemed an Iran-backed militia responsible and [killed 25 of them with airstrikes all over Iraq](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50951742). Which the Iraqi government really didn't like because they were not informed about those strikes and said militia is part of the [popular mobilization forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mobilization_Forces) that helped Iraq fight back ISIS.

In response to that, Iran-backed protests around the US embassy in Baghdad started, basically putting it under siege, until the [PMU called for them to withdraw](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/eihho7/breaking_iraqs_popular_mobilization_units_calls/), which they did.

Trump didn't like the optics on that, likening it to Benghazi, and thus killed a bunch of Iranian PMU leadership near Baghdad airport. Among them, [Qasem Soleimani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani), a Major General of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, and pretty much the most respected war-hero in Iran from the Iran-Iraq war, considered the second most powerful person in Iran after the Ayatollah."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 16:55:03

804	1578080405.0	"Soleimani is widely considered the best general Iran has had since the Iran-Iraq War, an expert on asymmetric warfare and commando operations. He heads Task Force ""Jerusalem"" of the Iran Republican Guard (basically a cross between the Marines and CIA), which means he’s responsible for Iranian public and secret operations in the Middle East. The US blames him for supplying shi’a Muslim insurgents in Iraq with explosives and guns during the Iraq War (which is probably true, said insurgents conveniently harassed any US military foothold near the Iranian border, making a surprise attack on Iran impossible), but more publicly he was the one who armed and trained three shi’a affiliated ""peacekeeping"" militias. The purpose of the militias were to keep the peace in key regions of Iraq so that the mostly shiite population there would vote for the pro-Iranian party that eventually came to power. Where they could get away with it without the Americans noticing, they would also discourage opponents from voting or even running. Soleimani is also believed to be one of the people who encouraged the Iraqi government to defund and dissolve militias originating in Sunni muslim areas. The idea was probably in order to prevent the pro-Saudi Sunni-dominated parties from pulling the same trick Soleimani had come next election, and it would also give legal reason to arrest or kill any Sunni leaders who refused to hand in their guns. This backfired spectacularly when the Sunni militias, angry at losing their jobs and frightened of purges if they surrendered, defected to ISIS. 

Because the Sunni militias had fought together with the regular Iraqi Army, said army collapsed like a house of cards afterwards with ISIS hitting American weapons depots, assassinating officers and jamming radio channels. Now in FUBAR conditions like these Western trooos are taught to hunker down and wait for reinforcements, but the Iraqi Army was mostly conscripts with an inexperienced NCO corps due to the US arresting most of the old Iraqi military. Even among those who *were* veterans, they probably remembered how they had held their ground and been outflanked and divided by the more mobile US troops in 1991 and 2003. So, without orders, ammo and comms, and without the courage to hold their positions, the Iraqi Army just melted away towards the south in small disorganized bands, many cut down by ISIS using technicals and American vehicles. This is when Soleimani became a household name in military circles, because he was the one who coordinated the three shia militias to work in concert with the Iraqi Army remnants and American troops to defend Baghdad from the ISIS assault. Buoyed by the allied success there, Soleimani traveled to Syria and was one of the key players in Assad’s victory there. The last few years he’s mostly been moving between Iraq and Syria, directing the Iranian fight against ISIS. He’s a big celebrity in Iran, even the token opposition likes him because he’s apolitical. More recently, however, there has been a crisis in Iraq, explaining why he was at that airport. 

Basically, the last few months Iran has been gripped by mass protests over rising fuel prices. The Iranian government has had to run a tightrope to use just enough violence to quell the things without looking like mass murdering lunatics. Even so hundreds or even thousands have been killed. In Iraq, angry Sunnis, sensing the weakness of Iran, begain mass protests against the policies of the pro-Iran government. Worried about the willingness of the police and army to act against members of the Sunni faith (they make up over half of the armed forces), the Iraqi government instead called up the three Shi’a militias to disperse the protests. This went about as well as one could expect, and within days the militias were firing into the crowds Blackwater-style. The US was furious and worried that this could restart mass ethnic conflict in Iraq, and so began neutralizing leaders of one of the militias most closely affiliated with extremist groups. The militia responded by launching a rocket attack on an American base, leading to one US dead and more wounded. The Pentagon responded by airstriking the militia’s headquarters, killing 25 of its top brass. This caused mass protests around the US embassy, which the militia then tried to use as cover to assault the compound. Because the Iraqi security forces are deliberately held back in Baghdad, there is little to stop the escalating violence in the capital. Soleimani probably arrived either to calm down the militia or try to help them work out a strategy. Whatever his reasons for coming to Baghdad and meeting with the militia leader, we will never know because an American helicopter drone blew the car up with a missile as it was about to leave the airport. 

Will it save American lives that the cunning fox Soleimani is dead? Probably. Will it benefit the war on terror overall? Probably not, he was possibly the most skilled anti-insurgent fighter in the world outside the walls of the Pentagon. Will it destabilize Iraq? Definitely. Will it cause mass retaliation from Iran in the form of blocking the Straits of Hormuz and supporting terror groups? Likely. Will it cause WW3? Unlikely, but it may spur Iran to actually go through with its threats to weaponize its nuclear program.

TL;DR: The US essentially did the equivalent of airstriking General Mattis at London Heathrow. International politics are likely to be sent careening into crisis by this for months. Most likely it was an accident, the US just wanted to assassinate the head of the militia they had been skirmishing with. The Pentagon is always extremely careful about targeting uniformed officers of national armies with airstrikes because it can trigger a war. Sure, in theory the President could order the strike, and President Trump is extremely aggressive towards Iran, but... He gets one-page intelligence briefings with mostly pictures. I don’t think he knows who Soleimani is."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 20:40:05

This isn't really a direct response to the post above me. I'm not really saying either position is really wrong or right in any case. I just get tired of the double standards from people on every side of the isle. I get tired of troops being a convenient thing for the left and right to care about, but only when it suits them.

In Iraq I can remember certain groups saying to get our troops out, you go fight instead, send our troops home. While the other side said how important it is we are there, the great sacrifices our troops are making. 

Then in Syria the sides flip flopped. People were getting upset that troops were being pulled out. They were concerned with how weak we looked there. Hell just two days ago a D senator said we are too weak in the middle east. Saying america is huddling in safe rooms hoping the bad guys go away. Then he flips to opposite talking points when something is done about the bad guys, and his followers fall in line with him. You see it with Trump supporters all the time.

The US also lost nearly all carrier-based aircraft. So what did the US do?

They had a ""do-over"" of the exercise according to a written script, and forbade the Iranian commander from responding with known Iranian tactics. As a result, the US ""won"". That ""do-over"" exercise is the official plan and that's why the US thinks it can win easily.

Conspiracy theory time. What if this *wasn't* the US, but an attack carried out by Saudi operatives. This attack would have sparked full out war between Saudi and Iran (which would still pull the US in). By claiming the attack though, the US is chest beating and daring Iran to respond.

1688	1578084197.0	"> Imagine a summer fire season when theres a dozen iranian agents with lighters.

So, no big deal then?

Seriously.

With lighters, it means easy to fight fires since you someone is just driving along the road lighting fires.  Can't light a lot of fires hiking on foot.

It is fires that start in isolated, back country locations that are the problem (for example, the Camp Fire where the first CalFire Captain to put eyes on the fire knew they were screwed since he knew there was no fire apparatus access to the location due to trail washouts along the power lines).  

But what about drones!

Winds are also a major component of the destructive wildfires you see in California.  Same winds that keep the aerial tankers grounded during fires like Camp Fire -- so you have fires in isolated areas with neither ground or air initial attack being practicable -- are going to mess with drones, and you need a lot more of them to create the multiple points of ignition imagined by ""Iranians with matches.""

Then you get into the domestic political spin of more California fires.

> It also sounds like he was the intended target, so why is this a bad thing and why did it happen?

He was almost certainly the intended target, as was another passenger who led the assault on the embassy in Baghdad this week and stated his superior officer was QS.

It's bad because it took entirely too long to happen. We could have saved thousands of lives if it happened 15 years ago. In truth, people are afraid of Iran's response which are likely to take the form of attacks on US positions across the middle east and potentially terrorist attacks in the US via Iran's Hizbollah sleeper cells.

It happened now because QS keeps his location secret at all times when he's outside of Iran or well defended allied countries. He's been on a lot of western to-do lists for decades now, but him attempting to direct Bengazi/Tehran embassy 2.0 was likely the last straw."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 16:06:02

Additionally, he's also behind the attack on the embassy on the creation and deployment of roadside bombs which have killed hundreds of American, Iraqi, and coalition members.

This could be a bad thing since Iran is an extremely temperamental and volatile nation, but I doubt Iran will strike back at the U.S. in some significant way. Remember that the U.S. has shown restraint in response to Iranian provocations over the past year.

Kata'ib Hezbollah responded by gathering with the other two Iranian militias and storming the US embassy, the US responded by first dropping troops in to repel them and then launching this airstrike killing both the commander of Kata'ib Hezbollah and Someimani.

This is what's interesting to me, in terms of labeling them a terrorist organization, by what definition would the CIA also not be a terrorist organization? 

I mean if someone had assassinated George HW Bush, would the prevailing international dialog be ""oh it's totally justified because he's responsible for tens of thousands of dead civilians in Chile""?

Both Clinton and bin Laden were both ""working for"" the CIA via George HW Bush who was the defacto head of the CIA controlling major portions of our entire foreign policy, especially during the Mujahadeen proxy wars in Afghanistan in the early 80's into the mid 80's during Iran Contra. Osama bin Laden was OUR GUY, like our major ""in"" with the political sphere. Then in 98 Clinton wanted to personally ""revoke"" his membership by sending tomahawk cruise missles at his training camp where intelligence thought bin laden was there. 

9-11 was the direct and literal blowback from Clinton's attack. Very few people want to ever mention this, but it bin Laden personally and openly declared this. Clinton's actions caused blowback in the form of 9-11, it wasn't a Loose change steel-cant-melt operation. 

That said, I think sending a tomahawk into the Al Qaeda training camp is like stirring a hornet's nest, whereas this is a bit different, especially as Iranians will see this as ""blowback"" from one of their guys launching attacks at our embassy."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 18:54:36

Iran doesn't arm Sunni jihadists who rank the extermination of Shias as one of their top goals - Kataeb Hezbollah is one of the many militias in the region that both violently opposes the American presence in Iraq, but also sent its members to help push back ISIS. 

The KSA is the state who was been erecting blockades of Yemen's port cities, and its presence and military activity in Yemen makes Iran's involvement look miniscule. Though this is a frequent error by American media, which overrepresents how much of the Yemen Civil War is simply a ""proxy war"" between Iran and the KSA. The conflict between the Zaidi Shia Houthis and the Sunnis in southern Yemen is much deeper and more complicated than just ""Iran v. Saudi Arabia.""

National leaders aren't generally inclined towards suicidal tendencies unless led by a complete and paranoid moron. At this moment, it doesn't seem like Iran's leadership is very moronic. America's on the other hand, at the moment, can be a serious liability.

The fact that the American government still manages to convince its people that it acts as a defender of ‘national security’, rather than the mafioso leader it actually acts as, will always anger me. The West, and particularly the US, have been deposing heads of state, high ranking diplomats, or even protestors, for the crime of disagreeing with the US monopoly of control since the 1930’s. 

June 1946 - strike by Iraqi workers, demanding the right to democratic freedom from the British, a right to a union, sickness pay and disability insurance. 10 workers killed, 27 injured. This was the country that Britain ‘gave’ independence to five years previously. 

1936-1939 Arab Revolt - Palestinian revolt for independence, crushed by the ‘democratic’ British. 5000 Palestinians killed, 27,000 either made casualties or imprisoned. British facilitated forced Jewish immigration, an obvious example for history of the long term consequences of exploiting and meddling in other countries. 

Removal of Kaman Junblat, Lebanese Minister of National Economy, for opposing multinational corporations giving national concessions to themselves, and wanting a unionised workforce. 

CIA-led coup in Syria, 1946. Syrian government did not ratify US oil demands, deposed and replaced with an American backed leader who did. 

Saudi Arabian General Strike, July 1946. Workers wanted unions, democratic rights, an end to Aramco’s interference, and the release of imprisoned workers. Leadership of the strike imprisoned or deported, identified by Aramco security forces, 

1953 Iranian Coup. CIA backed coup of Iran reestablished foreign control over Iran, after nationalisation of the oil fields from the uprising of oil workers against the Mossadegh government. Leaders arrested.

Assassination of Abd al-Karim Qasim, Iraqi leader. Survived multiple assassination attempts, but due to nationalising oil, was killed by the CIA in 1963. 

I’m going to give up here on this timeline, as it just gets too depressing. The US shows itself as ‘not one to mess with’ to its people at the expense of other countries for the sake of its own financial interests, and really, the financial interests of its largest companies. These companies have been running American foreign policy for nearly a century now, and still people are deluded into thinking the country runs on principles of enforcing ‘democracy’, and fighting ‘national security threats’ (when the former won’t sell it as well). It’s no surprise that people from the Middle East see through this bullshit, as it is countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and so on, that will remain crippled for decades due to the American monopoly of control, with a few million graves to attest to their refusal to have their freedom dictated to them. Without passing judgement, Soleimani‘s assassination shows the world how far we’ve come. A tweet of an American flag is all we need to understand why. 
For anyone that wants a more in-depth summary, and how American democracy can be seen through the literal movement of oil, read Carbon Democracy by  Timothy Mitchell. https://doi.org/10.1080/03085140903020598."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 18:15:58

It's actually a little hard for me to imagine that some of the comments you find fault with could be more lazy than this one. If you are going  to call out people for shitty arguments, then expect the same to apply to you.   You are going to have to be at least a tiny bit better. And you certainly are  not.
But it gets worse. It's almost as if you wanted to satirize your own comment noting  perceived whataboutism aimed at the US.  You actually ended with the observation of ""what about Iran"", which serves to deflect from the most hostile views of US actions that annoys you. If satire had been your aim, then with a little editing it could have been quite effective.

You may well  be tired of hearing certain arguments about how the US is perceived as worse via a vis other nations. But this is the inevitable outcome of being a global hegemon who maintain a global military force which topples governments and quite literally destroys nations that oppose it. It has been doing so around the world for the last 70 years or so. Of course people see it as the most dangerous and destructive nation on the planet. Objectively it is - as empires tend to be.

Trying to wave that history away as   a purity test is laughable and is among the most lazy arguments I would  be likely to encounter on this site today. The self satire just goes on and on.

2219	1578053838.0	"Since Trump decided to abandon the Iran Nuclear Deal unilaterally? Pretty much none. This is why everyone was predicting war with them when he pulled out of it. But here's some alternate history fan fiction.

What if, instead of just being like 'this deal bad, we leavin', Trump had actually tried to get the rest of Europe on his side? No one in the US sphere of influence liked the fact that Iran had been using it's new oil money to finance unrest across the middle east. Had he actually put in the time and effort to, he likely could have convinced them that the deal had not increased stability in the Mideast like everyone had hoped and that this meant a new approach was called for (assuming of course he hadn't also decided to deliberately antagonize them). Maybe then he could've gotten the rest of NATO to work with us on forcing Iran to not be a fuckin bastard, rather than against us.

But he did what he did and that left Europe working with Iran to keep the deal alive, because suddenly the one country that could bring everyone together looked about ready to start a war that would likely trigger a whole new migration crisis just as they were getting over the last one. This put the US in a weaker negotiating position and gave Iran the impression that they could play us against each other, emboldening it to choose escalation over diplomacy. 

The fact is, this didn't have to happen. We started walking on this path the moment Trump decided to pull out of the deal. It just took a year and half to finally get there."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 13:17:18

“Established during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, the Quds Force combined the roles of intelligence collection and covert action for Iran, taking the lead in the Islamic Republic’s special operations and proxy wars in the Middle East and beyond. It was the power behind Lebanon’s Hezbollah organization and now sought to weaken Iraq and kill U.S. troops in the country. The Quds Force was divided into departments or corps, with each corps having a geographic area of responsibility. Department 1000, or the Ramazan Corps, was in charge of operations in Iraq. It was the Quds Force commander, Qassem Suleimani, rather than the foreign minister, who set Iran’s Iraq policy. Suleimani wielded power in Iraq via a complex and shifting web of proxy forces. These included: the Badr Organization, which began as the Iranian-funded and-led armed wing of the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, or SCIRI; firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr’s militia, Jaish al-Mahdi (JAM, or the Mahdi Army), and in particular, its even more extremist and violent offshoots referred to by the Coalition as “special groups”; Asaib Ahl al-Haq (the League of the Righteous); the al-Gharawai Network in southeastern Iraq’s Maysan province; and Khatab Hezbollah. Suleimani found the Badr Organization (previously called the Badr Brigades or the Badr Corps) particularly useful. Badr and its parent organization, SCIRI, had a historic relationship with the Quds Force dating back to their years spent exiled in Iran during Saddam Hussein’s rule. They also had close ties to many Iraqi members of parliament. The Quds Force used the Badr Organization for intelligence collection as well as militia activities, with its proxies in the organization passing information directly to Quds Force handlers. Iran’s strategic goal of destabilizing Iraq created some strange bedfellows, with the Quds Force—the covert arm of Iran’s Shi’ite theocracy—even cozying up to Sunni insurgent networks.”

We should not revel in unnecessary death, but in the elimination of a greater threat.

The former goal wasn't achieved for denuclearization, only a slowing of production of highly enriched uranium. Iran already has the plans for the creation of nuclear warheads via Pakistan. 

The later goal didn't happen, witnessed by activities by Iran in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen prior to the United States pulling out of the ""Iran deal"". And frankly, it's unrealistic to expect that Iran would stop. A portion of their governments moral authority, as a theocracy, is derived from protecting the interests of co-coreligionists throughout the region and world. These interests will always conflict with those of Saudi Arabia and Israel. There will also be points of contention with Egypt and Turkey (And yes, they are still part of NATO and an ally of the United States).

If you’re going to call him a terrorist then you should label our founding fathers terrorists as well. To most the Iraqi people this guy wasn’t evil incarnate, he was trying to defend his homeland.

Would Iran be justified in assassinating our military or intelligence leadership for various terrorist groups and despotic regimes we've sponsored over the decades, civilians we've killed like on Iran Flight 655, etc?

Seems weird to assassinate this guy out of the blue when there are so many ""terrorists"" out there we don't assassinate, and in fact chummily work with (e.g. in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan). But Trump's justification for the strike is that this guy was actively plotting attacks against our embassies at the time. I simply don't believe him (nor do I disbelieve him necessarily). I just wish I could trust the info this admin puts out, but he's utterly squandered any benefit of the doubt he might've had as president. I believe he would absolutely lie about this if it suited his purposes, and no one in his administration would be brave enough to publicly contradict him.

Just because there are good reasons for something doesn’t mean they were done for the all the right reasons. This was a pretty good opportunity that was swooped up. Killing a high level foreign official of a nation that you have bad relations with is only done if you want conflict. It could have been done covertly and there would have been flexible responses. But this move calls for a retaliation from Iran which will require more responses from the US. And people are going to want trump to see this through. Downvote me all you want.

The second option is a “all bark no bite” strategy. They back off and stop being so aggressive while also unifying support from their population. Honestly this is the best option but I doubt they’ll do it. A lot of them are angry and many of them are higher ups who were friends with the general.

Third option is they stay quiet but start doing a lot more stuff like the Iraq embassy, and even plan terrorist attacks until they do something big enough that the US decides to invade or until enough time passes with no change that they just “return to normal”.

2 - Iran isn't hiding their anger with the US and seems to be getting their people onboard with the idea of retaliation through social media and state TV:

“Trump through his gamble has dragged the U.S. into the most dangerous situation in the region,” Hessameddin Ashena wrote on the social media app Telegram. “Whoever put his foot beyond the red line should be ready to face its consequences.”

This is literally what it is. I posted in another thread but it got buried and I'll do a speedy comment: US/Middle Eastern progress of the last decade or so could be done, the US looks like the baddies in the region and looks like the aggressors (remember everyone has their own propaganda), Russia proxy war through Iran is likely, Iran wants nukes badly and has been itching to get/make some, and our military has looked very disorganized the past several years so I would expect a very rough start if we do end up getting into a war.

Best case scenario is Iran just doesn't do anything drastic. Probably a terror related attack in the region or something is likely but hopefully nothing.

Worst case is legit war with them most likely targeting an allied country in the region (some think Israel or Saudi Arabia again) with help from possibly Iraq and other countries in the region. Russia most likely funneling supplies to them which will most likely have a decent uptick in Russia's economy.

Prior to the deal Obama and Europe struck with Iran, it might have been possible to just outlast them with sanctions to the point the regime collapsed before they fielded a viable weapon. After the deal, with the hundreds of billions of assets and trade that brought, it was guaranteed that Iran would be able to achieve a nuke if they wanted one. Whether they intended to continue pursuing one despite the deal or not is an open question, but regardless Trump pulled out of the deal so Iran was going to continue development.

Making the situation worse, Iran has to be aggressive because the US is now sanctioning it again. Iran can't take that lying down because they can't let economic unrest jeopardize the regime. 

So basically, because of the disjointed and contradictory (and terrible) policies of the last few administrations, we've now given Iran the time and money to finish its nuke and the motivation to use it (through a proxy terror cell of course) on the U.S. or allied target. The only way to stop them at this point is to wipe this regime out.

The commander in chief of Iranian Army, Gen. Ali Sayad Shirazi, was killed in front of his house in the 90s under circumstances that aren't really clear even today. 

The regime has always been afraid of military coupes. Doubly so now that it is not doing too well with the people.

The government regularly recruits unemployed youth (there are many of them) for its adventures in those countries. The general public is vehemently opposed to these, we have stated this in every protest.


But in doing so, they have overstretched themselves. The brief respite when US was involved with Afghanistan and Iraq and even their limited cooperation in that time made them bold. They could still pulled it off, if they did a better job of managing domestic affairs. They were far less successful in that manner and alienated the general public, losing the cohesion the country had after Iran-Iraq war.

The Baghdad airport is not very large in comparison to any of the aforementioned connecting airports though and you are highly unlikely to cross Americans that don't have family and speak a form of Arabic or are military there. You are more likely to meet Germans or Indians or UK citizens or really anyone else at that point.

Also, assuming you were an American that can't navigate the local region in times of conflict, you would probably be getting a call from the security company contracted to work with you telling you to stay put in your connecting city before you ever made the final leg of your journey.

Yeah... no. First of all the Iranians haven't ""taken over"" the Iraqi government, the Iraqi government is just pro-Iran because Iran an Iraq are natural allies (being two of the small handful of majority Shia countries in the world) and because Iran was instrumental in helping them defeat ISIS. 

And the notion that Iran has been using the PMF to slaughter Sunni protesters is just very weirdly divorced from reality, especially considering the really quite good analysis in the rest of your comment. There's a lot of things wrong with this but to start with  the protesters aren't all or even majority Sunni, the protests aren't really at all religious in nature. Iran doesn't control all of the PMF and the parts it does control are mostly centred in the east and south of the country and more importantly in the rural areas, not the cities which is where protests are happening. The forces killing protesters are mostly either Sunni militias unaffiliated with Iran killing Sunni protesters (primarily in the east of the country) or Shiite militias/police/regular army troops also unaffiliated with Iran killing Shiite protesters.

And it's also worth noting that it's not as if the Kata'ib Hezbollah launched a missile attack was some random unprovoked act of violence, there's plenty of good reasons for Iraqis to want the Americans out of Iraq."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 15:58:44

2935	1578068422.0	"Uh, so what if he was 'operating in Iraq'? First, he's allowed to 'operate in Iraq' according to international law. Iran and Iraq have a defensive pact to fight against ISIL, and their presence is not illegal. The Iraqi PM spoke highly of Iran and it's assistance and has never expressed opposition to it. They have just as much right to be there as America, maybe more so given the circumstances surrounding the U.S. 'intervention' (that is, the illegal U.S. occupation of Iraq just a decade earlier.)

Second, what exact operations are you talking about? The Iranian state and IRGC have been aiding Iraq since 2014, largely through technical assistance, the commitment of special forces troops, and air support. The groups which we usually call their main proxies in the region fought alongside the Kurdish Peshmerga and the Iraqi military against ISIL, largely under the organization of Soleimani.  They definitely aren't there to be altruistic, but to point to their presence as entirely malicious is disingenuous too. They've definitely committed their fair share of crimes, but as have the U.S. coalitions, the most infamous probably being Raqqa. 

As for the current escalation in tension between the two, while many are pointing to the recent attack on a U.S. mercenary stationed in Iraq, the PMF sees this as a retaliation to the nearly biweekly airstrikes they've been receiving and which they attribute to either Israel or the U.S. (although, in the PMF's eyes, they are usually culpable for the actions of each-other at least as enablers.) That isn't to pick a bone in this particular engagement, just trying to explain that the Iranian proxies see themselves as victims to the aggression of the U.S. coalition.

Once they broke open the gates, that should have been game on, with the Apaches and Marine security detachment shooting to kill, but they didn't.  Tear gas, stun grenades from the ground security and flares from the Apaches?  That's about as kid gloves as it gets.  Trump chose not to punish the grunts for attacking our embassy.  

No, instead he chose a more direct path....he went after the leadership.  This is the object lesson.  Iran's leadership may not really care if a bunch of their own troops get killed, but Trump is betting that they DO care about their own personal safety.  Trump just showed the Iranian leadership that they aren't safe anywhere, any time.  They can get got.  It can be as personal as they want to make it.  Will they escalate?

And then our grandchildren’s grandchildren come across a smartphone and wonder what kind of people must have created such a thing. 

This is not dramatic post-apocalypism. The Ancient Greeks came across ruins of the Assyrian Empire and thought literal giants must have lived there because the structural engineering tech had been lost to time. Early medieval Europeans stumbled across Roman aqueducts and had no clue what they were looking at.

Some years ago Obama negotiated a deal to help Iran develop nuclear energy while opening the labs to international oversight to make sure they aren't developing nuclear weapons. 

Trump broke that deal and started imposing sanctions unprovoked. 

Recently some American military actions killed some members of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia that fought against ISIS. A protest in front of the US embassy turned mildly violent: stones were tossed, break-ins were attempted. AFAIK no American died. The White House blamed the aforementioned militia, but there's no evidence that they were involved in the violence.

We just assassinated a foreign official of a country that we hadn't declared war against officially, in a third country that our entire diplomatic staff and citizen population has now been directed to flee. We will get more information over the next few days, but early reports out of DC are that the Gang of Eight didn't even know about it. 

Between December 11th and December 18th (one week), five high-level persons at the Pentagon resigned. The only two things on the public radar that might correlate with that would be if the Pentagon somehow got caught up in a Ukranian aid scandal, or if high-level people at the Pentagon didn't want to start a war against Iran, in Iraq, without Congressional approval of any kind. 

When someone attacks the US, we are supposed to have a decision-making process that deals with the threat in a way that protects US interests. Instead, we somehow just World Trade Centered the Middle East, and drove that same kind of fear of the bogeyman that the US felt in 2001 into everyone who opposes the US. Why would anyone in Iran or Iraq (or Syria, Palestine, Pakistan, or really anywhere else) assume that they could avoid conflict with an enemy that is willing to trash international law when it suits them? 

If this kind of thing had happened on American soil, to American leaders, we would call it terrorism and we'd be invading everywhere in response. Assassination and terrorism are different from military strikes, and we make the distinction based on the international rules we play by. 

The United States just showed the world that diplomatic rules mean shit. It is with the same about of rationality that the Executive branch could start bombing Mexico's government tomorrow for allowing the border crisis to occur. Facts become entirely relative without oversight or consensus or law, domestically and internationally."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 18:18:35

An attack that resulted in [zero casualties on the Saudi side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Abqaiq%E2%80%93Khurais_attack). 

Also had to add having an *unmanned* drone shot down for entering a sovereign countries airspace, how dare those Iranians won't just let US drones fly over their country? Who do they think they are?!  


>Don’t let anyone fool you - Iran escalated the violence aspect of this conflict.

Yes, because killing 25 Iraqis over the death of a single US American is in no way an escalation.

Just like literally assassinating high-ranking government officials, over a trashed embassy with *zero* casualties, is a completely reasonable and proportional response.

3183	1578098972.0	"We’ll have to wait and see what happens in practice but off thebtop of my head I expect to see:  
  
- surge in funding and assistance for terrorist organisations.  
- oil tankers being seized/attacked, with lots of boats ‘encroaching on Iranian waters.  
- Hacking and lots of it. Expect lots of ‘wiki-leaks’ reveals over the next few months.   
- internet disruption. Not entirely sure what their capabilities are here, nobody does, but cyber warfare is something that affects the US a million times more than Iran. You will need some imagination as to what this means in practice as it’s unchartered territory.  If unusual things start happening in the next few months, ask yourself if this could be a deliberate act.  
- ‘soft targets’.  US citizens don’t all live and spend all their time in the US. This one concerns me the most. I don’t really want to give anyone any ideas so I won’t elaborate.  
- Economic targets. War doesn’t just mean pointing guns at each other. Iran knows only too well that you can hurt the US by hitting its economy and they remain heavily reliant on oil (yet another good reason that the US should invest in renewable energy). Whilst the US can be completely self-sufficient in oil, that doesn’t mean that there won’t be an impact on prices and supply. The US is also very reliant on imports of a number of other things like rare metals.  
- ‘The Vietnam factor’. Ignoring all of the asymmetrical things they could do, don’t discount some form of armed conflict. The US is not popular in Iran at all. You must remember that the US literally overthrew the Iranian government within living memory and invaded their neighbours on grounds that turned out to be baseless. The citizens there are varied ethnically and politically but are united in at the very least, a distrust of the US. Put simply, Iran can tolerate a thousand deaths more easily than the US can tolerate one. Once the US body count starts rising, public opinion in the US will quickly turn to ‘why the hell are we even there?’  Iran is banking on this factor, particularly after nearly 20 years of fruitless wars and thousands of US deaths. Iran doesn’t need to ‘win’ the war, it only needs to hang around long enough for the US to withdraw. Bear in mind that Iran is virtually impossible to conquer and is why it has remained virtually the same country for thousands of years. Think Afghanistan on steroids.  
- Global opinion. Iran has been clever here. Whilst the global opinion on their shitty actions is not exactly positive, the world expects proportionate responses. When the shit hits the fan, nobody remembers the issue in a balanced way. To use an analogy, if a woman (Iran) keeps throwing beer in a man’s face (The US) and the man responds my punching her in the face, everyone will immediately forget what a bitch the woman was and instead turn on the man entirely for over-reacting. It is difficult to know how the global response would look but it will be at the very least another negative factor for the US.   
- Israel. Hawks in Israel have been itching for the US to attack Iran as they perceive them to be, rightly, a military threat. In the first Gulf War Saddam Hussein launched Scud missiles into Israel in an attempt to broaden the fight from a US/Iraq conflict to a larger Islam/Judeo-Christian one. Iran may well try something similar. Depending on how Israel respond, this could get very messy indeed.   
Yemen - Iran has been proxy funding Yemeni rebels whilst the US has been proxy funding Saudi Arabia. There are literally thousands of battle hardened Yemeni’s with an axe to grind that, with Iranian assistance, could do a lot more than they have been currently. Same thing with Hezbollah in Lebanon. This is actually quite a likely scenario and again, this will be messy, with ramifications that we can only guess at.   
  
In summary, anyone who thinks bombing this guy was an obvious thing to do because he’s a bad man, hasn’t understood why it hasn’t been done before. These are the same people who were unequivocally in favour of invading Iraq and gave zero thought to how this would breed ISIS. Make no mistake, this is complicated and messy and as it stands, the eyes of the world are looking at Trump like he doesn’t know what he’s doing, with the view that he escalated things unnecessarily so don’t have their sympathy."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 01:49:32

3294	1578092561.0	"Since we aren’t legally at war with Iran and recognize Iran as a nation, it’s called an assassination, which has traditionally been banned by executive order 12,333 and is a norm that has been upheld by presidents since Ford.

For reference Cheney (under H. W.) fired a general for suggesting that we would start a potential Iraq war by killing Hussein and his family. [Here is a scholarly opinion on the subject ](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1289&context=cilj) 

This order was made in response to scathing senate inquiries on the CIA assassinations of the time. Additionally an assassination of a public figure is well accepted as an act of war which gives Caucus Belli to the injured state, in this case Iran.

Should we accept what the intelligence community reports Iran is doing (while Iran denies it)? Probably not, and we have been responding to Iran in some form (mainly sanctions) for a while now. Perhaps what we had been doing is not enough but this is at the least a serious break from norm and at most a president unilaterally taking action and declaring war on a nation which seriously usurps Congress’ powers. 
Not to mention how dangerous the new international perception would be. Now every nation needs to consider that the US may take an unannounced first strike on its leadership if the president feels threatened by them. How will this change everyone’s decision making. I’m sure North Korea will take this in stride since they’ve been obsessing about a potential decapitation first strike for years.

So no, this isn’t about Trump or not liking Trump. This is a first for the nation and has very serious long term foreign policy and constitutional implications. 

What I will say is I, personally, cannot be confident that Trump weighed the broader consequences of his decision before making it, and in a situation where you had time to weigh the decision that would be reckless.
What is much worse though is that people on both sides so often go past the actual point and yell “TRUMP!” which redirects and trivializes the point into a partisan shouting match. That’s not productive, it’s not helpful, and is dangerous in and of itself. Deal with the topic at hand, then deal with the politics, otherwise everyone ends up shouting at each other about nothing and the important stuff is forgotten.

TL;DR: this isn’t something a president has done in the past. It is essentially declaring war without asking Congress. It makes other potential adversaries act differently which could be dangerous."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 00:02:41

The reason the hostages were finally released after 444 days was because Ronald Reagan was sworn in as President and the Iranian government knew he would not negotiate with them like Carter had. They were released the day he was inaugurated because if they had not been, the Iranian leadership would have been removed.	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 15:54:29

3744	1578089703.0	"Part 1, or: Reddit wasn’t meant for this kinda shit

While Iran couldn’t win in a 1v1 fight against a US invasion, they would hurt us.  *Badly.*

This is going to take two parts because there’s a lot going on, and because I write too much.  If you, dear reader, don’t care to read some long-ass shit, that first sentence, maybe the next paragraph, and then the very last three will tell you most of what I want to communicate.  Tl;dr, war with Iran would be unlike anything we have ever done.  The closest analogues in American military history are WWII, Korea, and Vietnam, but in real terms it would be unprecedented and unpredictable, two things the US military does *not* do well with.  We have the strongest military in history, no doubt, but it tends to train to fight the previous war, is expensive, and cannot spend much more than it currently does on either weapons *or* casualties due to the already massive strain it places on our budget and the American mindset towards war deaths.  Because of this, comparisons to previous wars are only helpful for demonstrating how different this war would be.

Unlike our other targets since WWII, Iran has a rather strong domestic weapons production industry, not to mention close ties to both Russia and China, who will likely give them at least covert financial and possibly material aid.  This means that instead of the US being able to simply remove all of the “pieces on the board” through standoff range strikes until we have air superiority as we have done since Vietnam, we will need to begin conducting manned air missions over a hostile airspace before being able to claim total air superiority, and even once we have total air superiority the possibility of new AA emplacements & MANPADS attacks going up without warning exists, meaning that the airspace will *never* be safe for American aviators until the backbone of Iran’s manufacturing - including secret and hardened facilities - is eliminated.  Even then, because of the latter issue, it won’t be totally safe.  This could take *years* and they have a demonstrated ability to defeat even high-flying stealth drones, which gives them an amount of parity we aren’t prepared for and haven’t seen, arguably since WWII.  That’s a long time for our expensive rockets, aircraft, and precious aircrews to be flying in a contested environment.  The cost will be much higher than anything we’ve seen since then.

Additionally, while we have the ability to attack from two directions by land (Iraq & Afghanistan) and up to two (the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman) by sea, *all of these are not 100% safe for our forces*.  Iran can at least partially, but likely fully, deny reliable access to the Persian via the bite at the Strait of Hormuz.  Certainly, at the beginning they will close the strait, this is almost certainly the first move that will be made in any ramping-up of hostilities which leads to outright war.  This is also likely to be the first hotly contested point in any open hostilities, because while the strait is closed or at least quite dangerous for large civilian ships, the world economy is on terminal life support and Iran knows it.  If they can keep it closed long enough, we’ll be forced to commit to another front to take pressure off it it in order to open it, and the forces we use to do so will be fighting for their lives in a non-permissive environment.  Russia benefits most from the closure of the Strait of Hormuz as a major supplier of oil through other means.  They’ll want to help keep it closed, and might go as far as kicking the hornets’ nest to do it.  Open war with Russia is unlikely, but not impossible as a result.

But above that, if that Strait closes our forces in Iraq will have to rely at least partially on overland convoys for resupply.  Those convoy routes were dangerous at the best of times, and it is not awesome the amount that we would be forced to rely on Turkey and their increasingly authoritarian Erdoğan regime.  Becoming central to the survival of troops in the theatre would make him pretty much impossible to dislodge at any point in the future, meaning that he would either command a great deal of respect within NATO - enough to move the entire alliance - or he’d have enough clout to force our allies who are less accepting of him to publicly do so, which may force a rift in the alliance which is impossible to repair.

We could do it by air, but such an airlift would take up a sizable chunk of our strategic airlift capability which dramatically lengthens the time required for placing the necessary manpower & materiel for an offensive engagement, costing us the initiative until the sea lanes are reopened - and again, that is *ignoring* the MASSIVE global economic repercussions of the closure of the Strait.  The longer we delay that offensive, the worse the global economic picture gets and the more money and power Russia and others who are not aligned with us are able to accumulate.  Additionally any troops we have in Iraq & Afghanistan should probably be considered “cut off” until the strait is reopened.  The option exists to evacuate them, or at least the majority of them, but this is akin to sacrificing what little forward positioning we have, and we’d need to re-invade eventually.  Any troops left behind would need to be capable of performing long-term defensive operations in hostile terrain with low-frequency resupply.  We could almost certainly hold Al Asad Airbase & BIA indefinitely, but troop levels would be limited and amenities significantly decreased.  It’d go back to how it was in the early days of OIF, but with a significantly worse local tactical picture.  Whatever the case, we would be forced to take control of the Iranian side of the Strait of Hormuz before much of anything else occurred.

This could lead to a truly contested amphibious invasion occurring against an armed and prepared adversary who still maintains aviation capabilities, or at least strong AA - the first such operation conducted by the USN & USMC since Korea.  It’s not going to be a meat grinder like we saw in WWII by any stretch of the imagination, but Marines will die, at least on the level of operations in Western Iraq & Fallujah c. ‘04 / the Iraqi Civil War.  This would certainly be the most difficult fight since the 2nd Fallujah, and it could easily be worse depending on how things shake out:  When and where we land, whether we’re forced to take and hold the cities, what the Iranians have in store for us at the time, and the ultimate objective (are we to capture and secure a beachhead and then fight inland to open up a third front to relieve pressure, or are we securing the entire area overlooking the Strait in order to reopen shipping ASAP? - that kind of thing).  This will require, at a minimum, at least 1 of our Marine Divisions and *bare minimum* a carrier group with reinforcements.  You’ll probably want at least two and to reinforce that MarDiv, but every asset we put into this operation is one which is removed from somewhere else, even if that somewhere else is just “in the rear, training or on leave.”  Also, since Iran knows the strategic value of the Strait, they will not give it up easily and once lost they will not consider it “gone.”

Certainly though, we can’t simply build up our land forces on their eastern and western borders and launch a blitzkrieg - we need air cover for that, and we can’t even be certain of base security in those zones at the current time because the local civilian populace would be at least partially opposed to us, and willing to work with or at least look the other way in terms of Iranian covert teams and partisans.  In other words, during the staging for such operations we might face attacks from the air, and on the ground we may face direct overland attacks as well as asymmetrical warfare.  General American understanding broadly categorizes much of these tactics as “terrorist” but that doesn’t really apply when we’re talking about soldiers - or “civilians” who believe they are soldiers, or people who are “soldiers” because their government has conscripted them against their will - attacking soldiers using non-textbook or even suicidal attack methods.  We wouldn’t call American soldiers who assaulted an Iranian position knowing that they would die in the process terrorists.  Civilian as well as military sabotage would also be an issue, the former motivated by ideology and perhaps assisted by Iranian forces, the latter conducted by undercover operatives.  This is another situation that American forces have not been in since Vietnam or even Korea, more or less."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 23:15:03
3745	1578089737.0	"Part 2, or: What the shit, will he ever stop?

Casualties from this can surely be estimated to be unacceptably severe, and the likelihood that such an attack would occur is small.  However, this is the attack that has the greatest chance of ending hostilities with a “victory” (depending on our definition of the word) in the shortest timeframe - the problem is that it will also be the costliest in terms of lives and equipment.  After all, I have only given the difficulties faced in *staging* such an attack - not *executing* it to its conclusion.  Once such an attack kicked off, our forces would be operating in hostile terrain with long, exposed supply columns and no air umbrella, which we have not done since Korea or arguably since the European Theatre of WWII.  It could get quite bad, and could go on for a very long time.  The only bright spot in this picture is that once the government falls, we will have almost total air & ground superiority, though there is a large amount of quite sophisticated MANPADS and anti-tank equipment in the area which guerrilla fighters would harass us with indefinitely - meaning that we would be conducting a *mostly* peaceful occupation of an area stretching from the western border of Turkey to the eastern border of Tajikistan.  

That is a *shit*load of ground to cover, folks.  There’s a whole lot of places to hide, and a lot of people within who would be willing to fight to the death to kick us out, and it makes our case to the international community that this is Just War and not imperialist aggression pretty fucking tough, especially as the occupation stretches out over decades.  Let’s not forget that the occupation of Afghanistan is now old enough to fuck with no end in sight despite the last two Presidents from radically different “sides” and for totally different reasons pledging to end it, and (so far at least in the case of Trump but let’s be real) failing.

Iran will not win a war against the US in a stand-up 1v1 fight, however besides the superpowers & proto-superpowers which currently exist, Iran has the most experience and best-trained, best prepared troops and doctrines for fighting a protracted and bloody unconventional and asymmetrical defensive war.  They have extensive in-house weapons production for their locally-designed and sourced weapons and systems.  They have oil, and some amount of nuclear, chemical, and biological capabilities.  They have non-local supporters with extensive training and equipment around the entire region, and some capabilities and support overseas.  They have positive relationships with our two main adversary nations who will provide them as much support as they can get away with, meaning basically unlimited funding and up to and including open military support if we are seen to be losing badly enough (though this is quite unlikely and would not occur until this time next year at the earliest, barring any absolute worst-case scenarios).  This is one of the World War III scenarios.  I see it as unlikely, but at the current time there is no less than a 10% chance it may occur.

Because of the strategic and tactical picture, doctrines which the US has trained in and executed throughout the careers of our entire military personnel body are largely invalid for the prosecution of the combat we are likely to face, and those who trained it it are in their old age.  Even those old hands are only trained in such tactics, pretty much everyone with direct experience is in a nursing home or already dead - and these are folks who fought in Korea and Vietnam.  I do not believe we have anyone left alive who has experience planning and / or commanding an invasion into hostile terrain under contested skies, *and even if we did* the weapons and tactics which were employed during such time were so unlike those which would be employed in this fight as to make that memory entirely unusable.  Keep this in mind when considering all of my “not since...” proclamations - even though we faced somewhat similar conditions in previous wars, *everything* has changed since then including the attitude we have towards the basic concept of war.  Those comparisons are almost useless, I employ them simply to stress how different this is from the Persian Gulf War, Bosnia, & OEF/OIF.

I’ve been out of the military for nearly 15 years now, but I’ve spent my life - ever since I was a toddler touring battlefields with my dad, all the while talking with his veteran friends - researching and talking about military doctrine, history, and possible future battles.  While I was in the Marines, both during my 1st deployment during OIF I & my 2nd during OIF III, my greatest fear was that we were setting up for an invasion of Iran that I would be a part of, so I have looked into such a possibility extensively.  We were better positioned for such a fight in the mid-2000s, but even then it would have been rough.  We will lose aircraft and aircrews, ships up to a Nimitz-class, and many hundreds if not thousands of troops.  Numbers for the wounded will be extreme.  The occupation will take decades and be more difficult than Iraq & Afghanistan combined, *and we will still need to maintain those occupations* under worse conditions.  

In the worst case, we are forced to fully back Sunni Islam as “the true Islam” and a large component of Shi’a Muslims, Sunnis who reject the authority we back, and those who sympathize worldwide turn against us, as our nominal allies persecute and massacre them, leading to a global insurgency which goes on into the foreseeable future, perhaps long after I’m dead.  Such an outcome would see hundreds of thousands of dead - if not millions - and would become a slow-burn non-nuclear (hopefully) global armed conflict consisting of worldwide invasions and occupations, often against civilian & paramilitary forces employing asymmetrical and sacrifice tactics.  At some point, Russia and / or China will probably get involved.  Whether this is in order to return some semblance of balance to the global strategic picture or because we have decided “fuck it, let’s do this global hegemony thing” and attempt to subjugate them is an open question and there are far too many variables, and it is much too far into the future, to guess about,  This is another World War III possibility, and I give it no less than a 25% chance of eventually occurring in some form, though some would say it is already happening and I can’t make a solid case to refute that.  

Percentage estimates for outcomes are rough and should be taken with an ocean of salt.  In fact, take it all with a grain of salt because up to all, or even *none* of this could happen.  Trump is virtually an unknown quantity strategically, and while he faces domestic issues he could see a war with Iran as good for his re-election prospects, and he could be totally right or wildly mistaken about that.  Iran is *also* a wildcard, they’re not likely to instigate a shooting war because they know that the outcome is the inevitable toppling of their regime, but they have been getting aggressive in Iraq, and working closely with Russia & Syria against ISIS.  The assassination of such an important figure, which could be seen or at least spun as totally unprovoked, may embolden them or cause them to feel forced to retaliate.

In other words, fuck it, we’ll find out."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 23:15:37

One of the biggest clusterfucks that has occurred in the US (especially since 9/11) is that Presidents have started using Executive Powers (Article II) citing “national security” to do pretty much whatever they want as Commander In Chief of the armed forces. Doing this sidesteps Congress and the need to “declare war”.  Again, we never declared war on Vietnam, we never declared war on Iraq... We just did it. So, effectively, there’s nothing to declare because they won’t declare it, but we’re already there.

> When the United States declared war on Japan after the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks, it signified one of the last times the country officially declared war.

> Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq: technically, those were not wars. Those conflicts, and other in between, are considered “Extended Military Engagements.” ^2

So, yeah... We’re already in this thing, y’all.

The nuclear program had the same goal, a deterrent that was meant to scare off US intervention. The Iranians are a lot of things, stupid they are not. They know that a strong US presence in the region is ultimately a threat to their national security and economic interests. 

Whether their actions are ""moral"" or not is kind of besides the point. Morality doesn't really factor into how governments work and why, especially when it comes to armed conflict.

And also Iran is less corrupted than its counter part usa.

The only reason they got massacred is prolly because of an Iraqi spy.... since they are hypocrite and just party over the death of anyone who tries to help.

Saddam was sunni they didnt like that > he died > they partied> they got fucked.

Iranians are shia they didnt like that > they got bombed > they partied> they will get fucked.

1) Warned the Russians we're about to strike and launched some missiles at an empty runway when Syria crossed his red line on chemical weapons. Despite previously calling our military dumb for giving advance warning of when/where we were preparing to strike in Syria.

2) Ordered a strike against Iran on the advice of his advisors, then canceled it at the last minute while planes were in the air because he got scared.

3) Fire & fury, ""totally destroy"" North Korea, etc. Completely backed down. Now even as NK overtly threatens us with nukes Trump continues to insist he has a great relationship with Kim, that he solved the crisis, and that he has a ""contract"" with him to denuclearize. Continues to beg Kim for another worthless PR summit while Kim lays out preconditions for it. Literally said that he and Kim ""fell in love"" after Kim sent him a ""very nice letter"".

4) Threatened to invade Venezuela and tried to depose Maduro. Failed. Did nothing.

5) Threatened Rouhani, did nothing: ""NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE""

And this sort of thing - assassinations, raids, etc. are about the full extent Trump will probably go. He's not going to start another bloody war in the Middle East - he'd be toast with his supporters in 2020 if he did that. So Khamenei is right. He can't *really* do anything.

4215	1578061577.0	Short version is this is the latest in a series of significant actions by the United States and Iran reacting to each other. Last week the US launched a series of airstrikes on militants within Iraq who had the backing of Iran. As a response to this, and probably with either the approval or at the direction of Iran, those militants and their supporters attacked and took over the US embassy in Baghdad. This killing is retaliation to the retaliation.	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 15:26:17
4216	1578061780.0	"

A US contractor (mercenary) got killled by an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia's rocket last week in iraq.  

So the US responded to that death by airstriking 5 sites used by that iraqi militia group, killing 25 people. 

So the militia group protested and invaded and burned part of the US embassy in Iraq's capital, Baghdad.

So Trump, pissed off about being impeached, and annoyed that he had been ""Benghazied"" by the militiamembers, decided to assasinate the Iranian general who he blames for backing the iraqi militia group.

The attack came from the North. The Yemen deflection was a poor attempt at shifting blame.

https://nationalpost.com/news/world/u-s-says-new-evidence-shows-saudi-oil-refinery-attack-came-from-north-reinforcing-iran-angle

>An attack that resulted in [zero casualties on the Saudi side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Abqaiq%E2%80%93Khurais_attack). 

The US didnt kill anyone as a result of that attack...

>Also had to add having an *unmanned* drone shot down for entering a sovereign countries airspace, how dare those Iranians won't just let US drones fly over their country? Who do they think they are?!  

The drone was in international waters. Iran claimed it was their air space because we got a nice pretty hd video of them attacking trade ships.

>Yes, because killing 25 Iraqis over the death of a single US American is in no way an escalation.

The escalation was obviously going from no casualty attacks to casualties. Something the US president made clear was why we didnt fire back after the drone downing. A large portion of iran really wants to attack Americans so they use other nations in the region and drum up the radicals while arming and training them. Thats what this general that was killed is good at.

>Just like literally assassinating high-ranking government officials, over a trashed embassy with *zero* casualties, is a completely reasonable and proportional response.

There were zero casualties because the US reacted swiftly.. the goal was obviously to kill those at the embassy. Embassy ground belomgs to the country it represents, so its the same legally as attacking a town in Kansas. This man orchestrated a direct attack on Americans and American sovereignty.

That means we tolerated the attacks on the refineries and the drones. We didn't respond harshly. 

Our major response came when Iran believed it could kill an American citizen (in late December) and then follow that up with an attack on our embassy. They clearly ramped up their attacks. And we have now retaliated.

4335	1578057847.0	"Hold up, are you trying to tell me this is the logic you're taking to support your argument? Because I'll tell you right now you're going down the wrong direction.

Soleimani was doing his job and it's rather known that Iranians leaders responsible for these kinds of operations take risks and put themselves on the frontline in order to rally the forces they're training/commanding/organizing. They wouldn't be so successful at organizing such effective proxy forces if they weren't taking such initiatives.

But you seem to think this represents some kind of thoughtless lack of self preservation instead of a well-thought out strategy of boldness in a region plagued by despair over the lack of courageous initiatives. The Iraqi force that took on ISIS successfully also happened to be the unit whose commander tagged along with them and maintained discipline. You might remember that a bunch of other units just ditched their weapons and ran without firing a shot.

It's just how things work there with the conditions and context of an unstable region with commitment issues. If gaining the trust and obedience of local militias you're training requires frontline leadership, then that's what they'll do because, ya know, it contributes to their mission of self-preservation as a nation. Hence the reason why groups like the shia militias and Kurdish forces tend to do a better job of discpline on the battlefield, beacuse their leaders *lead* within the context of what's required there. Even if that means putting themselves at risk(though to be fair, against a missile strike/drone strike/air strike, you don't really have much options for ""self-preservation"")"	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 14:24:07

4508	1578066276.0	"The ORB study was extremely flawed.

>Without a doubt the war in Iraq has inflicted immense human costs on the Iraqi people. Yet the conflict mortality estimate of 1 million deaths published by ORB does not withstand scrutiny. It is inconsistent with the survey data of the ILCS and the IFHS which are much larger and higherquality surveys. The ORB2 estimate also generates a number of implications which are not plausible: about 200,000 car-bomb deaths unnoticed by all international media, hundreds of thousands of unnoticed injured people who have apparently either not sought treatment or not been recorded as receiving any, a surprisingly low ratio of injuries to killings, and an implied gender imbalance in Baghdad that seems inconsistent with ORB’s own polling data. 

>ORB gives little information about its methodology, for example, not disclosing its sample design or translations of its questions, while information that has been released suggests some significant weaknesses. ORB’s presentation of margins of error and “ranges” for its estimates suggests that ORB has not calculated proper 95% confidence intervals. ORB2 did not record household rosters, asked an ambiguously worded mortality question and did not account for nonresponse in its estimates or “ranges”. The claim of ORB (2007b) to have drawn a “nationally representative sample” followed immediately by the ORB (2007c) admission of the need for substantial further rural sampling also casts doubt on ORB’s sampling procedures. Most importantly, our analysis of figures across the three ORB polls finds fundamental flaws in the data underpinning ORB’s estimate. The ORB2 data are not suitable for deriving any credible estimate but, given proper scrutiny, it is clear that ORB has overestimated by a wide margin.

To me, and based of more detailed spending records, it appears the US military invested heavily into Navy and Naval firepower, Air supremacy, and other highly technical areas, over using that money for recruiting or upgrading troops. That, imo, would surmise that we would wage a very aggressive naval campaign, utilizing tomahawk cruise missiles to destroy any and all radar stations, AA missiles and batteries, and other strategic locations to in other words, decimate their infrastructure. After first wave of firepower we would then use A22 and F35 stealth fighters to get deeper into territory to continue that decimation. Only after these phases were completed would the thought of boots on the ground be evaluated. 

Far more likely though is the US getting involved with proxy war in Libya. We would finance, train and arm the rebels to fight against the Hezbollah backed militias making ground there. Will be very interesting if this attack has any impact in how Erdogan pushes forward.

No anchor babies, or marriage loop holes. You get the boot, no black and white, no circumstance can shield you from it. Non-citizens are not the responsibility of the American government or the taxpaying citizens of America. This doesn't mean increased surveillance, it just means if you're not supposed to be here, get out. For example, someone overstays a visa.

Yeah that's never going to happen. **Ever.**

1. Their military forces have had no significant combat experience in nearly 50 years. They have not kept up with the latest advances in military strategy and technology. The vast majority of their military resources are spent putting on political rallies and parade performances, and buildups to intimidate Taiwan. And since they cannot even so much as take Taiwan the idea they could do much against the full force of the US military is a goddamn pipe dream.

2. They have no significant naval power as compared to the USA. They aren't even the primary naval power in their own ocean; we are. Their fleet primarily consists of decades old ships which have not been maintained. And the logistical operations needed to actually transport their troops anywhere outside of their own bordering ocean just does not exist, so they cannot sustain supply to their navy if they were to move it anywhere further than their own ocean, and if they were to try they would have to knock out US military naval bases which are in virtually every major port in the world. They will never get a ship anywhere near Iran before the US navy sinks their entire fleet to the bottom of the ocean. And other countries like India are not going to allow them to march their forces through their countries, either. 

3. Because of #2, the vast majority of military equipment and supplies they have been stockpiling are of extreme low quality and largely outdated. Some of their staple infantry weapons like the QBZ-95 are completely inappropriate for the realities of modern combat, which shouldn't be surprising because they haven't fought a major war in about 50 years so they have no real idea what their weapon needs actually are. Overly complicated, uses a bullpup barrel and has issues reloading due to its poor ergonomic design, as well as difficulty shooting in a prone position. This is just one of many examples of why their weapons arsenal buildup is not a serious military threat. They cannot even get their standard infantry rifle right. 

tl:dr

Having even hypothetically a billion forced conscripted enlisted soldiers who have no actual combat experience, use shoddy antiquated gear and cannot actually be moved anywhere outside the borders of China does not make them a legitimate military super power. They are more bark than bite.

People don't seem to understand there is a tremendous difference between the US military, and every other military. We have satellite systems nobody else has, we have extremely advanced defense and striking systems, we have complete and absolute dominance on land, sea and air. We have the best intelligence networks and we have the most allies. Our military has seen more action than anybody else, since we essentially are the world police at this point and have been for 50+ years.

China might be ranked #3, but there is a galaxy of difference between the #3 and #1 spot. 

We are the only country in the world who can wage war in every region simultaneously. And as most leaders in countries are not crazy despot fanatics, they don't have any desire to tug the tail of this tiger because they know they would lose in a conventional war against us. 

The whole reason Iran has turned to using proxies to fight us has been because they knew they would lose in a conventional war, and were counting on our politicians being too chicken shit to actually invade them because of the potential impact on the price of oil in the global economy."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 20:24:53

As wiki notes, in a 2004 poll of Lebanese adults, only 6% thought it should be disarmed, versus 41% who offered unqualified disagreement to disarming Hezbollah.

I'm pretty sure the distinction is drawn by the West because Hezbollah refuse to line up politely in their vastly inferior military brigades and get blown up in minutes by hovering US  drones. 

If you stand up to the US militarily and get blown away in seconds, then you aren't a terrorist organisation, but you're also dead. If you reshape the rules of war to work in a way that assists you, you become a terrorist organisation. Whether or not those rules matter is also, unsurprisingly, split down a West v Arab world divide. 

None of this is new - you only need to look at the way the US advertised internally Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The greatest misinformation and propaganda campaigns in a democracy need to be targeted internally at your own populace, to make them believe they're engaged in a 'just' conflict. It's a real risk to have them thinking - as they famously came to in Vietnam - that the military conflict and killings might be entirely unnecessary and unjust.

Technically the statement is true but it completely leaves out Watergate. Just like saying war helps presidents win elections without acknowledging why the particular war was popular with Americans in the fist place.

Just so you're aware. A war with Iran is incredibly unpopular with *both* sides. Less than 25% approval among the gun touting/foreign hating Republicans and much fewer than that on the Democrat side are supporting a war with Iran. Compare that with the 50/60% approval for an invasion of Iraq while America was still reeling from 9/11.

Our troops have the most combat experience in the world. And we would be at an advantage fighting a nation as opposed to terrorism  

We took Iraq with a brigade combat team. And a war isn't won with the Marine corps. They don't have the ability to build long standing infrastructure. We would use air Force Marine corps and  the airborne for an initial invasion establish the beach head with the Marines  and start moving inland. We would also probably go through Iraq to to create a pincer like movement and get them to split their forces. And shit we could even come in through Afghanistan.  

They don't have an air Force capable of stopping use and before we even started using it. We would use our cruise missiles to eliminate their air craft.  The most advanced jet they have is an F-14. 

All in all you are talking about a war. Shit we have been at war for nearly 20 years.  We have lost about 6000 troops. We lose about as many troops in training every year right now. 

You're forgetting Diego Garcia we can airlift supplies and will fly supplies straight in non stop to the middle East until the straights are secure.  Or we ship goods into Issreal/Jordan or Saudi Arabia and drive across the desert. Won't be pretty but it would get done. 

Ultimately I think you're over estimating the Iranians.  Which isn't a bad thing on it's head. But realistically they can hope to keep the  strait closed for any significant period of time.

 Iran can easily control the Persian gulf and immediately impact 25% of the world's oil production and can impact even more if the strait is blocked. It would also risk roping Russia into the situation if their distribution is liable to be impacted by the conflicts. Russia is uniquely situated in seeing this play out because theyve built a lot of the Iranian naval and army armaments and would probably be interested in seeing their capabilities in a live run through.

Each of the three Russian kilo class submarines Iran operates can deploy 24 mines without surfacing. 

A blockade of a few days would have disastrous results on a global level.

Right now Iran has much of the world more on their side than usual and American as more unpopular than usual. Iran should use that for all it's worth without needing war.

*The prime minister said the US strike violated terms of the US military presence in Iraq, adding that US troops were exclusively in Iraq to train Iraqi security forces and fight ISIS within the framework of a global coalition.*


They clearly didn't ask for their airport to be bombed or to be dragged into another quagmire.


*“The assassination of an Iraqi military commander who holds an official position is considered aggression on Iraq ... and the liquidation of leading Iraqi figures or those from a brotherly country on Iraqi soil is a massive breach of sovereignty,” Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said.*


Doesn't really sound like their government requested shit. Also doesn't sound like we're very good allies.

What, are you talking about just military support  in general post Hussein? That makes no sense. When we invaded their country and overthrew their last government our military never left.

* USA Team: Qatar - Turkey pipeline where the USA decide how gas (the new real resource after oil) gets delivered to Europe. It passes through Saudi Arabia. The US wants to control the gas delivered to Europe and have its proxy state and company (Qatar) to produce it through American oil and gas companies. They intervened to make it their business.
* Russia Team: Iran - Turkey pipeline where the Russian decide how gas gets delivered to Europe. It passes through Iraq (oh it blew up because reasons) and Syria (oh it blew up because reasons). 80% of gas produced by Gazprom goes to Europe, so they might want to control the European winters, so to speak. Like the USA they intervened to protect their old and new businesses.

Both pipeline will suck from the same gas pocket. The one that can sell faster wins. Apparently only one pipeline will be viable (and I still cannot get my head around on why).

The ""for the west"" is a collateral at best, a narrative to demonize the ""non west"" at worst. (It's quite the opposite from a chronological point of view on who is in the ME to curb whose influence taken the last 20 years)

You do realize that using the same reasoning, the US should be held accountable for a very long list of atrocities and terrorist attacks committed by [their proxies](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/26/syrian-rebels-turkey-kurds-accountability/)? 

Among them a certain Osama Bin Laden, who under the guidance of the CIA created AQ to fight off the Soviets and give them their version of a [Vietnam](https://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2003/04/2008410113842420760.html) war.

>Also, did miss the part where I said ""Want to down drones and lob bombs at oil refineries? Fine. You don’t get to kill Americans with impunity and attack our embassies.""

>That means we tolerated the attacks on the refineries and the drones. We didn't respond harshly. 

Are you sure that's what you actually meant? Most certainly doesn't read like that, and most certainly doesn't really work like that because all of those events triggered direct responses by the USG.

Actually pretty harsh responses, like putting additional sanctions on a country, and cyber attacking them (Which if done to the US, is [considered an act of war](https://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2012/06/05/the-white-house-and-pentagon-deem-cyber-attacks-an-act-of-war/#1265adee68ef)) over them defending their airspace against foreign intruders.  


>Our major response came when Iran believed it could kill an American citizen (in late December) and then follow that up with an attack on our embassy. They clearly ramped up their attacks. And we have now retaliated. 

Quite ballsy of you to take such liberties with the chain of events after I repeatedly listed the proper time-line, complete with sources. Do I really need to spell it out for the third time? Or do you actually consider killing 25 Iraqis, in multiple airstrikes, *not* retaliation? Because that's what actually triggered the embassy siege with zero casualties.

And none of that even goes into the issue of how the USG established it was those 25 Iraqis that were supposedly responsible for the attack on the US compound that killed a civilian contractor. The USG just declared them responsible and killed them, without as much as even trying to present any evidence for their involvement.

Yeah, wars are messy. The days of two countries sending their armies to fight until there’s a winner are long gone. Wars are won with brains now and the truly intelligent realise that the best course of action is almost always to not fight in the first place. The US has a population brought up on Top Gun films and never-ending USA Number One type rhetoric that unfortunately has led to a significant proportion of its populace too eager to ‘kill the bad guys’. It just doesn’t work like that and honestly, I had hoped that the recent experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq would have shown that but the comments I’ve seen in this thread greatly concern me.

Ever question why Iran begged for US to stay in a deal that was supposedly extremely tough on Iran?

Ever question why Israel, something Iran openly threatens to wipe off the face off the earth was vehemently opposed to a deal that supposedly should prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon? They should be relieved right?

Because it was a very weak deal from the beginning. It wouldn't prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon in the first place, but it also didn't even address other important areas, like ballistic missile technology, that is essential in the delivery of nuclear weapons. [When it comes to inspections, the deal is extremely weak](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-inspectors-access-any-site-iran-true/). IAEA would have to request access from Iran to inspect military sites for nuclear activity, which it could turn down. The deal gave Iran a free pass to do anything they like in the region, as long as they were technically in compliance with an extremely weak deal.

>Things were going fairly peaceful

What kind of a timeline are we talking about here? And it's very telling when you had to use the caveat ""fairly"".

Tanker attacks?

Iran trying to develop a nuke?

Yemen? (Support for Houthis)

Ballistic missile attacks on Saudi Arabia? (By Houthis conducted with Iranian missiles)

The Iran nuclear deal was insanely weak and basically gave Iran a free pass to do anything they like in the region, as long as they were technically compliant with it.

Oh yeah because Iran was such a peaceful nation but then Trump left the Iran deal.

Why do you think there had to a deal in the first place? Because Iran wasn't trying to develop a nuclear weapon?  Iran is engaged in a cold war with Saudis for regional control.

5634	1578140980.0	"I wrote a really long, in-depth analysis of the various ways in which you’re incorrect here, but I have a feeling you wouldn’t really be that interested in reading it.  If I’m wrong, let me know and I will be extremely happy to post it.  Instead I’ll attempt to summarize.

The only things that Iran & Iraq have in common are 3 letters in their names and a large, heavily armed Shi’a population which is at best highly suspicious of the United States.  Iranians are Persians, they speak a different language, (long list of other differences), but above all they have a domestic weapons industry which is capable of building and servicing their front-line equipment.  Iraq couldn’t do that, neither could Vietnam or North Korea for that matter, the last country that we fought with that capability was fucking *JAPAN*.  Does that mean that Iran poses an equal threat to us as Japan in 1941?  Certainly not, but our values are different now.

They will bloody our nose.  The Iraqis didn’t have anything *close* to the most modern Russian tanks - they had early-model, used, imported T-72s - which were their best tanks - which were poorly maintained, largely by contractors instead of soldiers because the overwhelming majority of their military were conscripts who hated Saddam but feared his retribution just a little bit more.  How many starving conscripts dead-set on surrendering or running away as opposed to firing their rusty AK-47 does it take to kill one of the most highly trained and disciplined, best equipped professional soldiers on Earth?  Check the Gulf War casualty list to find out.  The Iranian military is not only motivated, they are often fanatically devoted.  They are also well-equipped, highly drilled, and extensively trained.

We would be at an advantage fighting a nation as opposed to fighting terrorism, but Iran is a nation that embraces “terrorist” tactics as part of their military doctrine.  Meaning we wouldn’t magically go from fighting terrorism to fighting a regular-old, good-old WWII-style war where everyone had a uniform and played by the rules for the most part.  We be fighting a nation which had taken all of the leashes off of all of its terrorists and begun pumping as much materiel and target data as possible into its networks.  We would (honestly, probably *will* regardless) see a noticeable to drastic uptick in global terror.  Plus we *still* have to fight the war.  There’s no advantage - declaring war on Iran won’t make them tell their terrorists to stand down, I don’t know why you would think that.

There was a lot more to OIF than the operations of a BCT.  Just as an example, I was part of that invasion and I was in the Marine Corps, part of MALS-14, in an afloat I & D-level aviation maintenance facility supporting operations ashore.  During my second tour I was at Al Asad which was originally seized by Aussie SAS, and we supported complexes like KV, which was originally seized by British 22nd SAS.  You should also keep in mind, during the initial invasion we were fighting an Iraqi Army which had been under a weapons embargo for a decade after being decimated, which had happened 2 years after the end of a nearly decade-long extremely brutal war of attrition against the technologically superior and better-trained Iranians.  Just to give an idea of how desperate their situation was even back during the latter conflict, H-3 Airfield (eventually known as Korean Village) was bombed to fucking smithereens by the IRIAF during that conflict and it’s on the fucking border with *Jordan*.  The IRIAF has *always* been far superior to the IQAF, and while *one of* their most advanced jets is the F-14, they also operate MiG-29s, a variety of Sukhois, some Chinese airframes, F-4s, F-5s, Mirages, and a completely domestically-produced modernized version of the F-5.  All of these can be overhauled and maintained using locally-sourced parts, and are armed with locally produced missiles including copies of our Phoenix, Sidewinder, and an A2A adaptation of our Hawk in addition to numerous versions of Russian and Chinese missiles including a cruise missile which Israeli intelligence says is impossible to defeat - *all of which* they can build domestically.  Iraq bought all their shit, Iran builds all their shit, and none of the countries we’ve fought since WWII have had capable domestic military industrial facilities.

The picture when it comes to ground vehicles is actually more or less the same but worse.  Iran’s tanks are newer, including a true 3rd-generation tank & IFV, and they’re built locally from local parts.  Same is true for AA systems down to MANPADS, meaning their airspace will never truly be secured and they can sneak their missile launchers right up close to any of our airbases and use them, which they’d never have done previously because it would have caused a war, but that doesn’t matter once we’re at war, now does it?

None of the strategies you suggest are feasible.  Sorry, that’s just the way it is.  In the first place, once hostilities break out, the Gulf will be contested waters within range of Iranian ASMs and eastern Iraq will contain a population which is broadly hostile to our forces, & while western Afghanistan’s people might not be fully supportive of Iran like Iraqi Shi’a are, everywhere we’d be attempting to stage our forces would be well within the range of Iran’s air forces and cruise missiles, and in *both* cases we’d need to strike overland through hostile terrain for an extended distance with vulnerable supply columns.  There’s so much more to consider but just... look, Iran isn’t Iraq, and it *sure as FUCK* isn’t Iraq in 2003, and Iraq in the PGW was *still* entirely inferior to Iran as shown by the fact that Iran had just fought them to a standstill despite Iraq having American support.

Roughly 20% of the world’s oil supply moves through the Strait of Hormuz *daily* - if you think we can get it out through some other means than oil tankers you are laughably misinformed, sorry... it’s just not happening.  The primary beneficiary of any closure of the Strait will be Russia, giving them the incentive to help close it and keep it closed, and with the money they make they’re likely to be able to toss a little support to their Iranian buddies, and because of the rural nature of Turkmenistan & Kazakhstan and our lack of presence in that entire region save for a brief stint at Ashgabat a decade ago, they can move through the region pretty easily, especially if their wheels are greased by cash.  Meanwhile our “friends” in the Gulf will be hit pretty hard, chief among them the Iraqis, who are absolutely dependent on their oil exports to keep the shaky peace that kinda currently exists (the shakiness of which was a primary cause for this assassination, and the protests at the core of that were directly instigated by the Iranians). 

I’m not overestimating the Iranians.  They’ll lose.  There’s no question about it.  They may not even be able to kill 6000 of our troops in the process, but if our commanders have an attitude even remotely as cavalier as yours they certainly will, and perhaps more - because you are *definitely* UNDERestimating them and doing as many of our commanders have done - shit, it’s almost American military doctrine at this point:  Overestimate your own capabilities, underestimate the enemy’s, think of things in terms of the last war you fought, and believe that this will all be over before Christmas.  Remember?  We were going to be “greeted as liberators” in Iraq & Afghanistan, and then there was that whole “Mission Accomplished” thing, but here we are still fighting a war that’s legally fuckable.  Hell we’ve been making these same mistakes since the fuckin’ Civil War, you’d think we’d learn eventually.

Hell, what does “victory” in such a war even look like?  Will we be occupying everything from Turkey to Tajikistan?  That’s only roughly 1,000km less than the distance from the east coast of the US to the west, by the way.  How do you think that’s going to go?  These are the kinds of questions that *must* be asked before you start a war:  What is our timetable, what is the strategic picture, what will our allies do, what will *their* allies do, what is the victory condition, what will the post-war picture be, *can we afford this?*

Iran is nothing like Iraq.  A war with Iran will be different than any of our previous wars, and thinking about it in terms of those previous wars is a terrible mistake.  While they won’t beat us, they’re no paper tiger like the Iraqi military was - they’re not an actual tiger either, but even a housecat will fuck your ass up if you forget it’s got sharp teeth and claws and decide to go stepping on it and kicking it around thinking it’s just a cute little furball that can’t possibly hurt your giant ass.  Any cornered animal is dangerous, forget or ignore that at your own peril.  The one thing a war with Iran will have in common with our recent wars is that they win by running up our bill, *not* by beating back our invasion and then counter-invading and occupying our homeland, and they know it, and they’re the best in the world at asymmetrical warfare.  We’ll have to face international pressure to keep casualties and collateral damage low, they’ll face no such restrictions - we’ll be fighting on a short leash with long supply lines and a public that isn’t completely supportive, they’ll be fighting to survive with a population that contains many thousands excited to die if it’ll kill one infidel.  So, let’s keep these kinds of things in mind before we start writing checks our collective butts can’t cash, for the sake of my brothers and sisters."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 13:29:40

To protect Americans we killed Iran’s number two. How did it go with Afghanistan. Or Syria. Iran is vastly more superior with its military. Not only that America is now showing everyone that they will only do for America what they think benefits America. How did it go with Iraq? Or Vietnam? The truth is however big the army is, there always something that topples such empires. History has repeatedly shown us that. Whatever military might I have, conquest is the biggest downfall. 

America itself internally is fractured and badly. The Russians have made sure of that. A huge portion of Americans would even kill the other portion. This country already is at a high threat level to turn against itself. And now we have the most incompetent president ever trying to start a war with a country that is not a pushover. He has made enemies with everyone and insulted even our allies. If there was a massive attack on us soil I shudder to think what the subsequent actions will be with the nut in chief. You think a nuclear fall out only affects one place, this is not the movies son. And don’t sit there flexing muscles that we have a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons. You could have one thousand of them and your enemy only has ten. All it takes is for one to hit a major city such as New York to create a radiation field that would probably make its way 1000+ miles inland in all directions....for 3000 years. That is just from a ten megaton bomb. Ten saudis on three planes brought America down to its knees.300 million people. 

Do not underestimate the value of resilience and revenge. Best case scenario is number one felt threatened by number two so he sold him out.

The US, but more particularly Trump, has a lot more to lose than Iran right now in the short term. Iran have already had harshly punitive economic sanctions put on them now  for a long time, so their loss in a global economic crash would be marginal. Thus, I see a good chance of them completely fucking up Saudi oil fields and supply routes in the middle east. 

Trump has an election coming up and this unusually long economic growth cycle is on the precipice of a slowdown at some point in the next few years. A sudden large increase in the price of oil would be more than enough to tip it all over the edge. 

The Iranians don’t want a full scale war for obvious reasons, and any thinking American wouldn’t either, because it would make Afghanistan and Iraq look like kids play date in the park. 

I think Iran will take the asymmetric warfare to extremes. Cyber attacks, proxy wars, attacks on Saudi oil etc. They’ll avoid direct confrontation but they will want to hurt the US badly after this.

The US wants to strengthen their allies with the pipeline and curb the growth of the Russian economy. Russia wants to do the same to the US but also have bargaining power over the EU. Completely agree that no one is a benevolent actor. 

It’s about reducing dependence on Russia and strengthening ties in the Me. I don’t think the US would care if the pipelines to the EU were scrapped, just that they don’t want Russia increasing their influence. I don’t think the EU is collateral because the main objective is lessening reliance on Russia. It is then a chance to strengthen allegiances in the ME

I guess the “for the west” depends on if you think Russia having political and economic power over the EU is a bad thing. Also depends on if you think Russia controlling the ME is a bad thing.

The Democrats are never going to get the 67 Senate votes to convict Trump, and when he gets acquitted his support will only get stronger.

Of course they will tell that all those people on the streets are pro-Iran and stuff. I mean, it is simply easier to say that everyone there is backed by Iran than to say that some of them don't care about Iran but are anti-US. Do you really think, some PR firm asked about their political affiliation while they were protesting? No, so the only source that is telling us that they are militias are once again the leftist leaning MSM and the White House. Both of which have a horrible record in telling the truth (remember they want us to go to war, they will tell us anything to get there).

Since you bring up some cool historical facts: If you look at the root of the problem it all started with the toppling of a democratically voted president who was not happy with the fact that most of the profit from his countries oil resources went to foreign companies (mostly British, so the Brits were doing to them what they did to the New England colonies up until the War of Independence). Shit man, the colonists back then kicked British ass, who am I to tell anyone else that they don't have a right to kick some British ass if they are in the same situation?

Despite what the left leaning media is trying to tell us I can only recommmend any country to nationalize their natural resources. National resources should not be in the hands of companies from foreign nations or international corporations. That's basically giving away your sovereignty unless the people who run the companies also run the country.

When it comes to the violation of international rules one has to admit that that drone attack also did violate international rules. But you know what? We dropped that farce called international rules and law with the invasion of Iraq for the second time... there was no UN resolution back then, so why should there be one right now, right? The only thing missing is a bad powerpoint presentation by the DoD.

We do support countries like the KSA where gays and such people also have a tough time, so I really don't care about those issues. Especially, since the KSA has no problem butchering people in their own embassies and we see no problem with that.

And all those minorities you mentioned, half of those names I don't even know what they mean, but I assume they are brown people and also some sort of muslim minority? So who cares?

Y'all literally let the same sophistry that you shit on during elections brainwash you in times like this. We didn't airstrike a whole airport because we're defenders of the world or some bullshit.

Because not a single person who ordered the strike give a flying fuck about all the shitty things he did. Not a single person in our government cares. They only care about the fact that Iran's military thinking runs through this guy, and if he's gone, Iran is weakened. If I had to venture a guess, we've killed more civilians in military attacks this decade than the rest of the world has combined. And if we haven't, I'd say we definitely make up atleast 50% of all civilian casualties world wide.

That seemed hard to understand because one can easily find dozens of photos of Iranians holding “Death to America” banners but apparently for many Iranians they simply despise the US government rather than the American people.	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 20:19:14

Now obviously people often act in bad faith (white phosphorus is a good example of this) and utilise flimsy defenses for crimes or simply put forth that it was necessary (us vs them to the extreme), but ultimately, the law focused around war crimes are supposed to protect innocents and decrease the amount of suffering soldiers on both sides of the war receive."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 22:34:03

 And beyond that, we didn't even stack the bodies of the grunts on the ground that actually attacked our embassy.  We repelled them with non lethal means.  That's a very moderate response. Kid gloves you might say.

But still, you don't get to attack an embassy.  That's just a no go, especially for the US, which has seen its share of embassy attacks.  That's something that just won't fly.

There are so many variables to try to account for, but almost any outcome is bound to be dire. The first variable is the nature of Iran’s initial response. I predict they’ll plan it for about 36-48 hours more. We’ll probably see more than one embassy attacked before then.  Depending on how those assaults are handled, conflicts at the embassies alone could rage for weeks. 

Iran is also likely to cause nightmares and impasses in the Straits of Hormuz (thee major oil shipping route). This will lead to ships being shot at and blown up. Meanwhile, cyber attacks will rage on everything in both countries. The UN, China and Russia will do what little they can to shape and contain the conflict, but secretly Putin and JinPing will be happy to see the US savaged by a clumsy war. They will use the conflict to cement more power in their own ways, but will want avoid using force anywhere if they can.  NK will definitely pop off and go missile crazy in the meantime.

That's odd.

> There have been a couple US Presidents that have spoken against the CIA 

So where did that happen for those presidents? There should be a ton of sources that clearly show the issues this should have caused for them.

Not to mention your entire quote is based on the words of...a US senator. That's not adding much. Also that was way, way before Trump started full on claiming the FBI was a deep state propaganda wing by the democrats to discredit him, or whatever incoherent rant he went on. Not to mention the simple fact is that most of his attacks were against the FBI, the CIA was merely mentioned as also being wrong for not lying about Russia's involvement as that exposes the clear lies by Trump.

> Trump's also one of the few Presidents in modern times to openly call out the military industrial complex. 

He's literally expanded it at every turn, and has been openly war mongering in several different areas. 

> And we've literally seen half of congress flip-flopping anytime he makes  a foreign policy decision. Doesn't bomb Syria? He's weak 

Source?

> Bombs Syria? He's too aggressive. 

I think you'll find specifically the US removing the need to report civilian casualties and then massively increasing the drone strikes is what people complained about.

> Puts troops in?  He needs to pull out. 

All troop deployments were to areas that clearly again, were aimed at provoking an armed response. His troop redeployment to Saudi Arabia after a supposed Iran-supported attack there, is clearly nonsense.

> Pulls troops out? He needs to put troops back in. 

I think that has more to do with him openly betraying allies to Syria and Russia for personal/political gain. Last I checked certain parties were assured the US would remain in the region, and to complain with removing fortifications, to then suddenly retreat all troops leaving US allies to be slaughtered. Funny how people are against those sort of actions, huh?

> It's not to say Trump is some messiah, or that he's truly working in  America's best interests, or that he's even fighting 'the deep state' or  'draining' it. 

So..you literally say he isn't working in America's best interests, isn't fighting corruption...yet somehow this is fine because...?

> But at the  very least there's two positives with Trump. First, he's  openly pointing the finger at institutional problems, whether he's doing  it for the right reasons or not. 

Yeah, being corrupt is not ""exposing flaws"". That's just being corrupt. That's saying a thief is actually beneficial as it shows you weaknesses in your home/building.

> And second, he's exposing the flaws in the system, because the media has  their spotlight on him 24/7, and critiques every action, even lawful  and sane ones.  

What ""lawful and sane"" actions have been critiqued? Last I checked what is being critiqued is Trump's blatant nepotism putting his children into influential positions where they have no right being, using his children and his position to have foreign investors provide investments for personal projects and in return receiving green cards, Trump spending more time golfing in about 2 years, than Obama did in all 8, Trump constantly warmongering, Trump's blatant corruption, etc. etc. etc.

> Hopefully this will result in congress taking back the powers they've handed to the executive branch over the years.

>All Americans abroad, especially military, diplomats, and Government officials now have massive targets on their back. Plus, Iran's military is actually quite competent and considered to be one of the most Modern and largest in the world. 

Yes, but Iran does not have the force projection the US has. Any people entering enemy territory should also be well aware of the risks going into it. Also wasnt the same said of the Iraqi military back in the 90s and they got crushed in the Gulf War? 

If there was a war with Iran, I expect the objective would be to destroy and not occupy it, because that would be far easier to accomplish. I dont think the Iranian government would be that suicidal, because eliminating them would be the objective.

The best action Iran can take is to continue with asymmetric warfare and not escalate. That would be hard, because the general responsible for that just got assassinated.

No one is saying Solemaini is ‘innocent’ as you put it (he was a military officer not a politician by the way). I’m just asking for evidence to prove the allegations against him. 

In the UK, the British armed forces supported the US in an illegal invasion of Iraq on the pretext that the Iraqi government was plotting to use weapons of mass destruction on its near neighbours and even Western countries.

The US is no longer reliant on Middle Eastern oil. In fact, we’re a net exporter of oil - due in large part to fracking and increased refinery output. 
I’ll also add: Iran attacked Saudi oilfields a few months back. It didn’t even register on our market radar.

But let me do your [homework for you](https://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1?r=DE&IR=T):  


>According to a September 2016 [study](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf) by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, some 3,024 Americans died from 1975 through 2015 due to foreign-born terrorism. That number includes the 9/11 terrorist attacks (2,983 people) and averages nearly 74 Americans per year.   
>  
>**Since 9/11, however, foreign-born terrorists have killed roughly one American per year**. Six Americans have died per year at the hands, guns, and bombs of Islamic terrorists (foreign and domestic). 

You are way more likely to die due to a sharp object accident, an animal attack, a heatwave, an airplane and spaceship (sic!) accident, getting shot by police, getting accidentally shot by a fellow patriot, bicycling, choking on your food, or literally *any* force of nature.

Sort of. The Iraqi military was large but they were far from modern, especially their Air Force. The Gulf War went the way it did due to Iraq losing air superiority almost immediately, and not having air defenses to protect their columns and bases. By the time Desert Storm started, morale among the rank and file Iraqi troopers was below zero. The Revolutionary Guard was a threat, but even their best equipment was generationally outclassed; the Battle of 73 Easting is a good example of this.

The Iranians aren't anywhere close to the same level. Despite best efforts by NATO, they've kept up to date with their equipment, and their air defenses and air force not as dated as one would expect. Reliable Intel is that they have been able to keep even their Tomcats upgraded with weapons and avionics made domestically with help from other nations, including Russia. Russia also has shown interest in quickly selling them Su-30 fighters in the event the JCPOA crumbles. Their air defenses batteries include a modern variant of the S-300 SAM system which has proven itself a threat.

As for force projection, they don't need as much reach as you think. The Strait of Hormuz is the most likely point they will focus their aggression, likely by shutting it down to all traffic except that which they allow, and I wouldn't put airstrike on any of the American Bases in the region past them. If they do either of those, they'll be actions that unfortunately will require more aggression on America's part, and the escalation will continue."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 17:19:40

The USA has been preparing for the wrong war for decades now. It's highly unlikely to be a clash between powers using conventional warfare. What we will get instead is what Russia and China are already practicing but on a much larger scale - asymmetric warfare and cyber attacks.

A huge part of the problem is that the civilian and political worlds in the US no longer have a notable overlap with the military and so it has been put on a pedestal and protected from any real criticism. This, in turn, has perpetuated a jingoistic attitude where politicians see military funding as a way to look good to voters and create jobs in as many districts as possible simultaneously, while also creating a culture in the military where the good officers who speak out on issues are sidelined in favour of sycophants.

The results of this are that, for all their material and technological advantages, the NATO militaries will have lost any war with Russia or China before it even begins. And you can be sure that Iran isn't operating without Russian knowledge and approval."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 00:16:30

Very little of a companies value is based on physical assets (unlike cash on hand for example). My original statement is a mild exaggeration but the stocks contributing most significantly to the economy will not be able to be affected by piracy or attaks on cargo vessels. 

What is Alphabet/Google or Facebook or Microsoft shipping?  Same with amazon or apple. These companies combined account for more then 4 trillion in marketcap. That is more then most countries GDP. For amazon they are a logistics company with a warehousing model distributed across thousands of locations around the world with no one site being important. For apple, maybe shipments of iPhones from China? But if you think there is like some super cargo ship only full of Macs you must be crazy. That shit is spread across hundreds of cargo vessels or more likely transported in planes. Further no cargo ship is solely filled with one companies assets. Even if you sank a few the goods lost would be spread across hundreds if not thousands of companies and really not felt at all in the market. 

So what can they do then maybe sink an oil tanker? Sure they could but likely the environmental disaster (for them in their back yard especially), but global cleanup would cost more then any oil lost. 

I just don’t see how blowing up 1 or 2 cargo vessels or supertankers would have a huge effect on the sp500. More economic ramifications would be felt by the response to such attack which would almost certainly just bring market volatility due to uncertainty of going to war with Iran.

All that being said, going into a full on ground war (which would be needed to fully ""passify"" Iran) would be a disaster for the U.S.

If you've ever seen videos of the Iranian army's operations in Iraq and Syria they have a ridiculous and diverse amount of hardware, they have tactical training that is second to maybe only the IDF (even then its debatable), and they have the ability to conscript almost the entire male population as that has been one of the MO's of their government since '79.

Not to mention Iran is entirely encircled by mountains that are more likely than not fortified to the gills and contain underground reinforced bunkers for operations and shelter from bombing.

The US can display all the power they want outside of Iran's borders, but any attempt to fully disarm them would be disasterous.

It really can't. And Iran would never attack the Use directly. 

Saudi Arabia would be dragged into the war, and their incredibly fragile oil fields would be destroyed by masses of cheap ballistic missiles by Iran. Suddenly, attacking Iran has caused the single largest oil crisis ever and your supply line is now limited to what you had in reserve. Iran would fund Hamas to carry out terror attacks against the US.

The US simulated a war between themselves and Iran in 2002, and Iran won. Iran has been preparing for this likelihood for twenty years at this point, they'd be much stronger.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002

>Red launched a massive salvo of cruise missiles that overwhelmed the Blue forces' electronic sensors and destroyed sixteen warships. The losses were as follows: one aircraft carrier, ten cruisers and five of six amphibious ships. An equivalent success in a real conflict would have resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel. Soon after the cruise missile offensive, another significant portion of blue's navy was ""sunk"" by an armada of small Red boats, which carried out both conventional and suicide attacks that capitalized on Blue's inability to detect them as well as expected.

The US only won the situation when ""Red"" (Iran) had ridiculous constraints placed on them: 

>After the war game was restarted, its participants were forced to follow a script drafted to ensure a Blue Force victory. Among other rules imposed by this script, Red Force was ordered to turn on their anti-aircraft radar in order for them to be destroyed, and _was not allowed to shoot down any of the aircraft bringing Blue Force troops ashore._ Van Riper also claimed that exercise officials denied him the opportunity to use his own tactics and ideas against Blue Force, and that they also _ordered Red Force not to use certain weapons systems against Blue Force and even ordered the location of Red Force units to be revealed._


The US got utterly trounced in Vietnam fighting against guerrillas. Iran's entire _actual_ military strategy is based around those tactics. A US war against Iran would be an utter disaster. 

Unless your solution is ""glass those bastards"", in which case the US can hold absolutely zero claim over the moral high ground (it's entirely questionable that it has it now) and would be evil without question for the murder of millions of innocent civilians."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 23:20:08

The person he replied to maybe is doing a whataboutism with that line of questioning, but if thats true then the original criticism of the US because of other actions not related to the event is also a whataboutism... and simply responding to someone with ""you're doing a whataboutism"" is a whataboutism."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 03:33:56

Even if he was scum of the earth, one of the tenets of this country was equal rights under the law, and we denied him due process when he was executed at a public airport. Just because we are fighting people who use ""terror"" doesn't mean we should stoop to that level as a nation, regardless of how normalized it has become.

7051	1578087867.0	"My claim: Iran is behind the crackdown (killing) on Iraqi anti-government protestors. 


My source: the Iraqi protesters themselves
 https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iraq-anti-government-protesters-denounce-pro-iran-crowds-200102144314331.html

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/05/pro-iran-militia-supporters-converge-on-baghdad-protests

I'm having a hard time copying the exact references from the article right now because I'm on mobile. But in essence, Iraqi protestors have voiced their anger in that Iranian elemente have been meddling in the Iraqi government and corruption is rampant.

What also is noted was the double standard treatment that the pro-Iran protestors got when they were besieging the US embassy compared to the Iraqi anti-government youth who were shot down in the hundreds. 

Iraqi protestors are enraged that a foreign dictatorship such as Iran is seizing control on their government and rightfully so. The Iranian response? Shoot them down. 

If what I said goes against what is given in the articles please point it out. The Iraqi's protester's message is loud and clear, there's no way to misinterpret it as Iran being the peaceful side in all of this.

Side note: Osama's Saudi citizenship was revoked long before 9/11. He was the enemy of the state and he hated Saudi's guts. But ofc you won't know that because you feed on the circlejerk."	ej7ykn	2020-01-03 22:44:27

**One**, per year, not one per day, because there are 365 days in a friggin year, meaning for the other dude to make any sense, there would need to be at least 365 foreign-terrorism related casualties per year in the US, when the actual number is ONE.

From the article: *""It was unclear whether the attacks were carried out by Hashd al-Shaabi supporters or, as some protesters speculated, by people working on behalf of the state or another entity trying to sow discord within the anti-government forces.""*

You make out of that: ""Iran is behind all the killings of Iraqi protesters!""

Which obviously has everything to do with Iran controlling Iraq, and nothing with the universal hatred of US presence in the region.

Some are, others are not, but don't let that stop you from painting absolute pictures.

Which of those protesters message? Are you really trying to imply that all the ""legit"" protesters are anti-Iran, and those that protest against the Iraqi government are all Iranian plants? 

It should also be noted that I did nowhere claim that Iran is being the ""peaceful side in all of this"", nobody in that situation is peaceful, it's a giant massive cluster-fuck in which you are trying to pour gasoline by attempting to put all the blame on one side, and just that one side alone.

You people always fall back on this shit. It's funny and pathetic at the same time. You really think I don't know your talking points? Like I don't live in a country where the president and the idiots he has working for him aren't spouting their bullshit at me on TV every single day? Believe me, I know your side of the story. And it's horseshit. And deep down you know it's horseshit. But it's comforting horseshit, I'll give it that. That beautiful vision of ""good guys beating the bad guys!"". 

Hate to break it to you though, the world ain't like that. The world's a shithole. 

There's a story by Ursula K Le Guinn called *The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas*. In it she gives you a moral problem. Imagine a utopia, a place of pure happiness and joy. Now imagine that somewhere in that utopia is a room with a small child. This child is beaten and abused and left to rot in its own shit. The continued existence of this utopia is dependent on whether or not this child is left to suffer. If the child doesn't suffer that perfect place falls into ruin. 

In that story some people choose to walk away from paradise altogether, and refuse to take part in one evil or another. 

You're the kind of person who'd both torture the kid and let the city fall to shit, depending on whatever the fuck the president told you to do at that moment.

Allow me to explain this to you: if the strait of hormuz closes, the entire fucking economy around the globe collapses. This isn't just gas prices.

Why would I give special attention to some asshole contractor killed in a rocket attack? It's easy to say ""who cares"" when its not your neighborhood isn't it? 

I don't think you really appreciate how bad things can get, and will get. That shit last week was a bar fight compared to what's probably about to happen. 

>e you saying we should just let these militias overrun where they want because if we do something they might attack back?

The only thing the US is ever going to do in Iraq is make the situation worse. Justice does not exist. How many times do I have to type this? The only thing that is going to come out of this is an escalation in violence. And for what? Because the US wants another puppet in Iraq? Tell me, why do you think we somehow ""deserve"" to run that country? We're no different then the Iranians. People like you destroyed that country back in 2003, this is the fruit of it. 

Maybe we should stop trying to impose our will on a region that doesn't want or need us hm?

- The last time a major ally followed the US into a war it was a political disaster for the leader in charge (Tony Blair). 
- Trump polls terribly in Canada and Europe, and despite what you may think, the democratically elected leaders of those countries care deeply about polling. 
- Why would any ally have America’s back when Trump is pushing “America First” and wouldn’t have their back? He keeps shit-talking NATO, which is the strongest military alliance in the worlds right now. 


Then for this specific case, the other signatories were very happy with how the JCPoA was working, and feel like the US betrayed them by unilaterally leaving the agreement. Why would they believe that the US would honour any other agreement? 

So I guess my question to you is, why WOULD any of the other major world leaders back up Trump’s US?"	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 01:44:53

I don't actually agree that the move warranted a coup, mind you.  I'm just saying that nothing happens in a vacuum.  Whether or not an action is proportionate is a completely different story, but at the end of the day, both sides think they were justified, for both good and bad reasons.  It's not like the revolution was a democratic process that truly represented the will of the Iranian people (but, of course, neither was the rise of the Shah).  Nor was the overthrow really the start of US-Iranian relations.

Nonetheless, the way you wrapped up your post is exactly the essence of my opinion on the matter, however, it works both ways.  Iran isn't going to sit back either.  I do happen to sympathize with one side more than the other - I don't want to live in a theocracy, Islamic or otherwise.  However, I don't expect Iran to continue getting pummeled until they give up without fighting back.  I would hope the sanctions break them down until they come to the table, but old foes don't necessarily just turn around and become fast friends.  The USSR crumbled and Russia is still an ardent antagonist and is diametrically opposed to the US strategically, even though the conflict between communism and the west is dead.

The revolution was only coopted by the religious right after it had sparked, but the leaders of the revolution were unprepared for the brutality and outright evil that faced them from the religious fanatics, much more violent than anything they faced from the Shah.  

Almost over night the revolution became islamic, and a group of sectarians who had built networks in the shadows took over the state.    

A minority of the most religious people cheered when he took power in a completely undemocratic way, that is true.  

But it's like if Richard Spencer should declare himself supreme leader of America, and 20% of Americans would rush to the streets and celebrate. And then 50 years later, some ignorant moron would use that footage as evidence that USA elected and loved Spencer.

You know you're saying this, but you can't point to a single thing I have said that is not true. You know as well as I do that the middle east isn't a fucking video game. That there's no ""good guys"" there. You've been seeing it played out on the news for 20 years. Longer, even. Centuries. Millennia. 

You know the funny thing to me is that you guys are always hoping for a ""mission accomplished!"" moment like Bush promised you. But you never get it. All that ever comes out of our meddling, out of your batshit desire to see ""justice"", is more and more innocent people dying. 

> The strait produces what 1/6 of global oil and 1/3 global gas?

And disruptions to that cause economic blowback that send shockwaves throughout the entire global economy. Oil runs the modern world, you fuck it up you bring that world to its knees. 

>You really think Iran will be able to hold off the entirety of not just the US navy but any other navy from nations that would face “economic collapse”?

I don't think you appreciate how much damage them even threatening that can do. Doesn't matter if we ""win"", the region will be thrown into chaos and the damage will be done. Again, this is not a fucking movie. Nobody ""wins"" in the fucking middle east. 

>A positive of killing Osama Bin Laden was that we fucking killed Osama Bin Laden???

And now the Taliban controls half of afghanistan and more every day. 

Bin Laden got everything he wanted from 9/11, and you gave it to him.

Nothing I am telling you is hypothetical. If you throw a ball in the air it comes down. Law of nature.

Doesn't matter. I already went over this. This guy being a sack of shit doesn't mean anything in the broader context. 

Innocent people are going to die because of this. A lot of them. 

>u can type justice does not exist all you want to continue being a shitty edgelord doesn’t make it any less true? You could type how smart you are and that’s definitely a lie so what is your point? Typing something over and over to convince yourself doesn’t mean shit to me. I mean we defeated the Iraq army and dismantled its government that right there lends credence to the fact that we would probably be the ones to remake it in our desired image

Well that's incoherent. 

We beat Saddam and destabilized the entire region and accidentally created ISIS, never mind made room for Iran to move into Iraq in the first place. That's what happens when you start a war in the middle east, you open up new and bloodier avenues of bullshit. 

Do you *really* think invading Iraq ended well? Please. 

>. But hey when we get our draft cards we can continue to discuss how everyone is now going to die the global economy will cease to exist the sun will burn out and the mole people Iran had contained for centuries will be unleashed. Hopefully we all don’t die in a massive nuclear attack from bombs Iran has managed to hide in birds man!

You and your dumbfuck warmongering party is going to cause a conflict that is going to further plunge the region into chaos and kill massive amounts of both innocent people and the American troops you claim to care about, but obviously don't. 

You know this. You're jumping around that reality because it scares you.

7849	1578107174.0	"The US is directly responsible for the instability in that entire region.

First by staging a coup against the democratically elected government of Iran, leading to a chain of events that gave us present day, religiously headed Iran.

Then by fucking up the first gulf war, namely letting Saddam stay in power, which led to tensions after the war he just fought with Iran?

Third by coming back on the flimsiest pretext ever and finally displacing Saddam, only to replace him with a puppet government that isn't supported by the population.

Let's go abit further:  
U.S. airstrikes and regime change policy in Libya has unleashed an ongoing civil war, divided the country between at least two warlords, and enabled arms and militiamen to cross the southern border and destabilize West Africa.  


In Israel/Palestine, decades of reflexive U.S. support for Israel and Donald Trump’s doubling down on that policy—by moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and turning a blind eye to Israeli plans to annex much of the West Bank—have ensured, once and for all, that there can be no viable Palestinian state.

&#x200B;

In Syria, American meddling in the civil war, self-destructive support for various Islamists groups there and military intervention on behalf of the Kurds have broken Syria into a mostly jihadi, rebel-held northwest, Assad-regime center and U.S.-backed Kurdish east.   


The point is that the U.S. has irreparably fractured a broad swath of the globe from West Africa to Central Asia. Interventionist pundits in both parties and countless think tanks insist that the U.S. military must remain in place across the region to police dangerous “ungoverned spaces,” yet recent history demonstrates irrefutably that it is the very intervention of Washington and presence of its troops that fragments once (relatively) stable nation-states and empowers separatists and Islamists.  
Counterproductivity seems the essence of U.S. military policy in Uncle Sam’s never-ending, post-9/11 wars. Call me crazy, or wildly conspiratorial, but after two hopelessly absurd wars and studying the full scope of American military action, it seems that maybe that was the idea all along."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 04:06:14

Yes, Suleimani was behind the embassy attacks. I agree with you. I do not think that was right. 

I do, however, take issue with the ignorant narrative that the embassy attack was the first provocation in this entire exchange. It was not. No amount of fantasizing or faux outrage can change that.

I take issue with that narrative because it allows apologists, like you, to try and explain away or minimize the egregious nature of the Suleimani killing. To be clear, it was an extrajudicial assassination of a foreign policy maker ordered directly by the President of the US and with no congressional input or notification of international allies, INCLUDING the very ally whose territory the assassination took place on.

That is batshit fucking crazy and I won't let you obscure that fact because it makes you uncomfortable.

It also directly puts Americans of all stripes in harm's way. And for what? Why? What did we gain, strategically speaking? Nothing.

The world is more nuanced than this food fight mentality you are espousing. 

There is a reason all other presidents in the past have practiced what is known as 'proportionality.' It would be helpful if you researched that term and tried to understand what it means.

Killing Suleimani is an INSANE escalation which promises only get Americans killed. This is why people like you and Trump should not be within a country mile of decision making power. You have no ability to separate your own ego from the right course of action.

The Japanese government launched an unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor during peace negotiations, killing thousands of Americans including civilians. The American POWs in the war that followed were completely brutalized. They were starved, beaten, stabbed, shot, beheaded, drowned, burned alive, and probably some stuff I'm forgetting. The Chinese got it much worse. But I don't blame people living over in Japan today. I don't hate them, they had nothing to do with it.

The Vietnam war was started on it, as was the Iraq war. We have a wealth of precedent for this. In the same way, everything about these events is built on suppositions. When a propaganda machine starts rolling, it's a very convincing thing to watch, but we have to learn to be suspicious of everybodies motives. I'm not saying these people are wrong, I'm saying they have terrible evidence. We don't know the chain of events leading up to what has happened, only what is fed to us. When you've eaten bad fish once, your brain learns the smell, and the march to war always has a stench about it. This smells as bad as anything else I've witnessed.

Well, to start with I'm not justifying the killing of non-combatants.

As for which strikes are justified and which aren't, that just depends on the circumstances. This guy was responsible for hundreds of American deaths in Iraq and he wasn't going to stop. I haven't seen anything justifying an Iranian military general killing random U.S. troops in Iraq. The U.S. conducting a military strike against someone who is attacking U.S. military and embassies without any provocation would not justify a retaliatory strike.

You get mad at me “putting words into your mouth” but refuse to say those things out loud: you didn’t want anything to happen to Soleimani or Iran and would have preferred to keep the status quo despite the recent attacks and sectarian violence in Iraq perpetrated by Iranian forces."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 03:08:31
8023	1578125693.0	Xenophobic?  I am first generation, lol. US has the duty to take this scum out. I am Liberal, capital L. Not a fascist or whatever you think. I can actually spare out the nuance of these things. Like people always bring up the cold war conflicts. But they never bring up how peasant central americans and Southern Asians ended up with Sino/Russian arms. Same here, Iran's revolutionary guard is spreading this bullshit for  forTHEIR own economic and regional control interests. So sparing them, while thinking our own economic interests are somehow this evil thing, is a bit disingenuous.	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 09:14:53

Sure we do, if we want to continue trading with them; particularly oil.

> They hate us and there’s always going to be someone trying to kill us or start something with us out there. 

There's a very long and good reason for this dating back to the Cold War era (and even beyond that if you scope it far enough). Continuing to maintain negative relations with any country has historically shown to escalate into future conflicts. Trying to maintain current and future peace requires an active effort, not a ""ignore them and hope for the best"" approach.

> We can keep our embassy in Israel and that’s it.

So what happens if middle eastern countries continue to engage in conflicts with Israel (who are not saints either)? We're currently allied with Israel and they ask for either materialistic/financial aid or military aid? If we help in any way, that's going to antagonize relations with middle eastern countries and further escalate their desire for terrorism. However, if we maintain peace with both sides, we're able to better negotiate a continuous and long-lasting peace."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 08:02:42

Also your estimates from pew ignore legal immigrants (as it solely focuses on illegal immigration) and the birth rate difference between the immigrants (both legal and illegal) vs the native population.  We are talking about an entire demographic shift of these nations, where Caucasian Europeans become the minorities in their own nations.  That is absolutely overrun by immigrants.

The truth of the matter is: People are living longer and birth rates are below death rates.  Social systems rely on the next generation being equal to or larger than the generation they are supporting through social programs like social security.  If the next generation is smaller, there is not enough money to pay out.  So to have a welfare state, the state population MUST expand and/or the state income MUST expand (which is done via increased taxation or increase of the taxation base or the government owning businesses and acting as a shareholder to receive some of the profits).  So Europe is forced to bring in migrants to fund its social programs.  That is just the reality of the situation.  They are seeking to replace workers with immigrants and in doing so are completely changing the moral, ethnic, cultural, and religious identity of their nations - all because they are a bunch of greedy little shit heads who all clamor at the bit to steal each others money for ""healthcare"" and other stupid shit that each individual is ultimately responsible for themselves."	ej7ykn	2020-01-04 23:05:09
