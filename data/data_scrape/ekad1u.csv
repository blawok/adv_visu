0	1578243752.0	As an Iraqi, I agree that there’s many misconceptions being made about the two countries. However, people are people and you can’t expect everyone to study the history of the two countries before making a comment on a relatively recent event. If a war broke out between Slovakia and Hungary, do you know the history of each country and which languages they speak? If you study history you probably do, but the everyday person may not recall the political situation and history of the two countries, so for some it is easier to read a headline and a quick article, and they might then express their views. Posts like the YSK one are also helpful for those who didn’t previously know. Comments like the ones you brought up might then appear as you can’t expect everyone to fully understand the background of the situation.	ekad1u	2020-01-05 18:02:32

Out of curiosity, what do you think will happen? Will Iran retaliate like the US did? Or will they actually take a legal route like the papers say?"	ekad1u	2020-01-05 18:52:29

5	1578250929.0	That's the issue with Reddit. It seems like it's largely driven by emotional outrage. It always applies a black-and-white lens to what is always a more nuanced issue	ekad1u	2020-01-05 20:02:09

8	1578270756.0	"Not Persian, but I relate to your frustration. I was in sixth grade when 9/11 happened and suddenly everyone around me, even the kids my age, were suddenly experts on the Middle East. There was a ton of misinformation being shared with the gravity of insider secrets.

But my extended family is blended, and my dad and uncle lived in Iran for several years in the late 70s. My dad was the first to correct me about the Arab/Arabic and Persian/Farsi misconception. My uncle met his wife over there and she regularly exposed us to her culture when we were growing up. One of my fondest memories is the “Persian Thanksgiving” we had one summer because they had been out of the country the previous November and couldn’t join the rest of the family for Thanksgiving. (BTW please don’t misunderstand, I know Iran doesn’t have a summertime Thanksgiving equivalent holiday, what happened was we all got together, my aunt cooked a ton of really amazing food, and we called it Persian Thanksgiving)

In 2001, my uncle, his wife, and my cousin were living in Qatar. So everyone I knew was looking at the entire Middle East as this mysterious, homogenous, enemy “other” and I just couldn’t because I had family there. And about two months after 9/11, we were visiting with them at my grandmother’s house and my aunt called my sister and I into her room and talked to us for hours about what her childhood had been like, what her family was like, and what Iran is like now. It wasn’t a lecture. I remember she was really funny and relatable. And it was so different than the image of the Middle East that we had been fed by the media and by various authority figures. In following years, my dad continued to educate us about the history and current politics of the region, and encourage us to research it ourselves.

So ever since then it’s been incredibly frustrating for me to listen to what people have to say about Iran and Middle Eastern countries in general, knowing how ignorant they are. Especially Iran. Out of all of those countries, I think Iran is probably one of the most misunderstood and underestimated.

I know it probably doesn’t mean much when it seems like the majority of people are happy to believe lies, but I just wanted to share and let you know that there are some of us here who do know a little better."	ekad1u	2020-01-06 01:32:36
9	1578241994.0	"i mean, many are kids who don't know better, memes are never about being historically accurate, it's about nihilistic humor (in this case) I know some on /r/teenagers are posting because this is a genuinely scary situation for some of them. who knows if a draft will happen? many say nothing will happen and if something does, a draft wouldn't happen but the future is not set in stone.

10	1578272991.0	Propagandists understand, at least in American culture, that people don’t read past the headline. That’s why politicians speak in 10 second sound bites, even if they blatantly lie or pivot later in the same speech. Most of the media is just blatant fabrication or twisting of facts to fit their narrative and it’s a lot easier to do these days. People are lazy. The amount of bullshit peddling on social networks is infuriating. Thank you, OP for level-headed perspective.	ekad1u	2020-01-06 02:09:51
11	1578259986.0	Welcome to Reddit, bud. Where truth doesn't matter, reality is a meme, and if don't you make everything so polarized that it's black and white people will flip their shit. I love Reddit for some of the really cool things you get to see and experience, but by the gods does the ignorance to how this whole world functions a glaring stain upon the community.

15	1578254882.0	I was listening to LBC last night and heard a caller talk about how Iran was heavily misportrayed in the media. I think the lack of understanding in the public is caused by the lack of knowledge and reference to middle eastern countries apart from when it comes to war. It doesn't seem to matter than most of the wars nowadays are a direct cause of US war mongering. As far as your average brit or american is concerned they're all the same (middle eastern countries), because that's all they've been fed. It takes a unusual amount of curiosity to lead someone to actually learn about other countries. Good on you for learning English anyway and taking an interest in the rest of the world.	ekad1u	2020-01-05 21:08:02

18	1578255632.0	"Hey, listen.

People are very similar, I bet Iranians and both Americans would be similar in ways. The thing dividing them - is their goverment.
When the majority of reddit is made of US people, you get to see all sorts of nasty things, and that's normal. What's not normal though, is goverment spreading propoganda, literally lying in front of their faces and then basically blaming everything on external sources.
There are still people believing in Trump that he is the greatest. It should tell, that the same people might be posting here on reddit and twitter, and that something is indeed wrong.

19	1578266780.0	Fucking morons on Reddit will think some random westernized Iranian (who’s parents are LITERALLY Shah sympathizers) is representative of any significant portion of the Iranian population. The irony of the post. The irony of the comments. It’s hurting me.	ekad1u	2020-01-06 00:26:20
20	1578262841.0	I'm sorry, I can only imagine how frustrating it must be. Unfortunately, we live in a time when everything has been politicized. President Trump or President Obama before him could make the most benign, altruistic decision they could possibly make, and half the country would throw a fit about it. The only solution I know of is to just to try and tune it out. It's going to get much, much worse before the year is over.	ekad1u	2020-01-05 23:20:41

I'm confused here. According to wiki, Persians don't speak Arabic (or at least it's not a majority language). They speak a language called Persian or Farsi. This is in accordance with the post you referenced above. What are you saying is incorrect here?"	ekad1u	2020-01-05 22:25:45

No, you saw an officer do something and immediately thought it was wrong, and you didn't even bother to look up the facts.  I swear, if people actually took not even 5 minutes out of their day, there would be so much more peace than there is now.  Once again.

My mum and I asked them about their country and they told us about the strict laws and oppression that goes on because of the dictatorship inforced there. They said many people do not agree with it and told us that it is amazing to leave the country and just let your hair down. The woman, Sanaz, got on really well with me and told me there is a really good film I should watch called Persepolis. She said it was a good starting point on learning about the country and many people felt the same way as Marjane. The fact religion/religious practice was forced on them, the society they lived in after the revolution. It's a great film and insightful into the life of someone growing up there.

35	1578281821.0	"Here's all I know about the middle east:

I grew up in a diverse neighborhood that had combined ethnic festivals because there wasn't enough of any single demographic to have a bunch if different ones. Everyone showed up and there were booths and tents and shops featuring many different cultures.

One booth was a middle eastern family serving ice cream. The woman at the counter handed me my ice cream and I high fived her ( I was nine. It was my thing). The husband came out and shoved my dad and was screaming about me having touched his wife.

The booth nearby was selling handmade jewlerly, and a middle eastern family came out, saw I was scared and people were angry, and while the dad started singing and clapping his hands, his wife grabbed me by my hand and showed me how to dance like her.

My father was somewhat well known in Iran because he used to be one of Ebi’s (famous Persian singer) producer and he made a lot of connections, but once the revolution happened things hit the fan real quick and my dad was pulled over and taken to prison. He was tortured in prison for 6 months without any of us knowing where he went until he showed up at our doorstep one day with his stomach cut open, body bruised all over and his clothes all ripped and everything. They were using a whip to torture him. They took him in because he was involved with the music industry and also because we are Jewish.

Many people don’t understand that Persians do not like their own government at all and the government doesn’t merely represent the rest of us Persians, because we are nothing like those soulless selfish animals. My dad was so happy to hear about the Iranian general. It seems like my dad actually somewhat knew the guy through school and he said the guy was always power hungry, selfish and a Dick so he got what he deserved, especially after being responsible for some of killings he’s ordered."	ekad1u	2020-01-06 00:22:33

Persians did the most in history to develop and spread Islam, and the Abbasid caliphate (one of the very early ones) was based entirely on Persian culture. Muslims historically have also done the most to preserve and spread Persian culture, with works like the Shahnameh, Kalila wa Dimna, Masnavi, Golestan, Divan e Hafez, and more were all written by Muslims. Persian language and culture spread to its maximum extent during the Islamic era as well.

Islam was to a great extent Iran's own doing, and Iran had and wanted no other religion until modern times when Europeans began to shame Iranians for being Muslim. You grew up in a non-Muslim society, so it's convenient for you to deny Islam to fit in better with Americans.

150	1578267253.0	I have worked an known many Iranians that fled Iran in the 70's and 80's.  That takeover destroyed a thriving economy and culture and relegated the people to a life of religious micro-managed shit.	ekad1u	2020-01-06 00:34:13

152	1578267767.0	It came as no surprise to me that there'd be a lot of Persians celebrating what happened. I live near a Persian neighbourhood in Toronto, and there's a large crowd of them that stage anti regime protests almost weekly in Mel Lastman Square. A couple days ago, they were out in full force and louder than usual. They've been hoping for some kind of intervention from the west (particularly the US) for decades.	ekad1u	2020-01-06 00:42:47

155	1578269314.0	"Hey, thanks for this post. Even the small bits you mentioned here are quite enlightening.

It is very disheartening, and I imagine frustrating for those like yourself who have first and direct secondhand knowledge of the issue, that so many people are so quick to spit out their hot takes, virtue signal, and toe the line for their political/ideological tribe.

It’s never popular to wait for more information or to research what those more knowledgeable than yourself have to say. But alas, such is the way.

I just watched this video:

159	1578269674.0	Great post. Things are commonly depicted as 'us versus them' while there is none. A country is merely an imaginative border with people who have many different opinions and cultural habits. So often do I see the media and people in general refer to 'the Russians', 'the Americans', 'the EU', 'the Islam' etc etc. Although it is really to use such references, these entities do not really exist. This is also why I think that war is so useless. If I have more in common with a citizen at the other end of the world compared to some in my own country, why fight with the 'others'? Sadly, as long as everyone keeps thinking what would benefit only their 'own' people/country, the us-vs-them way of thinking will remain.	ekad1u	2020-01-06 01:14:34

In the US, the Middle East is portrayed as a lawless, radicalized area, but reading about Iran's revolutions, and your most current constitution has me confused as to how this skewed image has come to be. My intuition tells me there is a lot more at play here, particularly regarding the demand for fossil fuels, and international relations between the US, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. I'm sure I'm missing more.

Can you expand upon this, so I can better understand what is going on here? I know I'm pretty ignorant on the topic of this conflict, but at my core, I fear war. I also feel like many of my countrymen, particularly me and the younger generations come from a more empathetic and compassionate place, and truly mourn the loss of life, the pain and suffering a war will cause.

186	1578273027.0	"I, as an American with no familial ties to the middle East, am well aware of this.  I am aware that our involvement in Iran is one of our worst examples of economic imperialism. In the 1950s Iran decided that it wouldn't allow us to pump out their oil, and nationalized it so that they could sell it to us.  This decision, which is well within their right, was the start of the bad blood.  Our response to this was to overthrow and install a ruler who allowed us to continue exploiting their natural resources.  

What this all came to a head in 1979 when the Iranian people overthrew our proxy, and he fled the country to avoid a trial.  This was when they stormed the embassy and took hostages.  They wanted to exchange the hostages for our proxy to return and face a trial.  We wouldn't do it, and they didn't kill any hostages.  We then supplied Saddam Hussein with arms and chemical weapons to wage war on Iran, which he did.  But we go pissed when he used those chemical weapons on another culture in the area we were not at odds with, the Kurds.

Hell, people don't even remember Hussein's trial.  We were putting him on trial for killing 80+ Kurds with our weapons.  Hussein's attorneys were arguing that the United States should be a codefendant in this case since we gave him the weapons.  It was then his attorney was murdered.  No other attorney stepped up to defend him, and within days he was hung.  I'm not saying he didn't deserve it, but you don't prove someone is covered in shit by jumping in it too.

I know damn well I would hate any country that came into mine and began issuing orders over what we could do with our possessions, and then began screwing with my government when it didn't work.  These are not the actions of a just and noble country, which is why it pisses me off when people act as though we are still the same country that defended both sides of the world against the Nazis and the Japanese.  We have done nothing but instigate and initiate since.  It is impossible to make an informed decision when you actively ignore anything that makes you look bad."	ekad1u	2020-01-06 02:10:27

It’s astounding just how much garbage and hate is floating around the web. I personally am not the kind of American that believes all other nationalities are out to get us and want to ruin this country with ‘death and destruction to America’. The truth is, there are bad people with ill intentions on both sides that is filling our minds with misinformed propaganda, putting a bug in our ear that all outsiders are  evil, that our God and our beliefs are more important than You and Yours. I’m ashamed that ‘We Americans’ have been force fed this bullshit for as long as I can remember, which is another reason I no longer support or am active in organized religion. 

I can’t apologize for everyone else but what I can do is apologize for my ignorance and make a promise to be a better human being, to be more understanding and not jump to the first conclusion I come across. I can’t always deduce which news is real and which is fake because in America, you can post whatever you want and if it’s the least bit relatable to what you’ve been sold, it’s easy to believe. 

How, as an American, can I help change this? How can we work together to change this stigma? What would you do if you were on my side of the fence to encourage change? We only see what is put out there whether it be our local news or social media. All We know is what they sell us.

I’m always really nervous to ask these questions because some people get really mad or just don’t know the full truth. 

How much of the Middle East actual agrees with the Islamic religion? Or willingly follows it? I’ve seen some stuff about how a lot of people over there think it’s oppressive and want to escape it, but my college pushes Islam as the religion of peace and that everyone who follows it, follows it willingly. I know there’s different types of it but I don’t know what they’re called or how they work/worship.

All white people are wealthy and privileged, all black people are poor and oppressed, and all brown people are somewhere in between because brown is kind of the average between light and dark skin colors. (Asians are considered white (even though you can't give them a color besides white) because they're all millionaires whose parents murdered their way here and stole that money from the indigenous people of this land.) All brown people who aren't hispanic are Muslims and come from a country called _The Middle East_, which is a lot like Middle Earth, but maybe not quite as real. _The Middle East_ is where deserts and suicide vests come from. And don't try to tell us that Iran and Iraq aren't the same. Their names are even 75% the same, and they're both municipalities in _The Middle East_.

307	1578285471.0	"A few years ago I picked up a book called 'Iranian Rappers and Persian Porn: A Hitchhiker's Adventures in the New Iran' by Jamie Maslin. The book substantially changed my impression of Iran and it's people. 

After close to a decade of war in Iraq, Afghanistan, ""axis of evil"" in the headlines my image was that Iran was similar to those countries in geography, culture, and politics. I was wrong. 

My recollection of Maslin's travel to Iran described a country with a beautiful landscape filled with life, including some of the world's most impressive natural parks that would be a huge draw for Western travel if the media showed them. The people he described as being friendly, welcoming of guests, enjoying global culture, proud of their Persian (not Arab) heritage, of a conservative Muslim culture by design of the authority, but of their being a very secular youth that desired change in government. It is well developed and highly populous. 

My lasting impression was that war with this country would be very different from that in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have hoped for political change from within and struggle to imagine Trump's ham-fists can be the change the Iranian people and the world desire."	ekad1u	2020-01-06 05:37:51

No time like the present and Reddit losing their collective minds over the situation in Iran and proclaiming World War III is upon is it just the perfect example of that. That Iranian Commander we just merked was a piece of trash, and the only negative here is that he likely didn't suffer when he died, and that we had not done it years ago.   


Iran isn't going to start a war with us, China isn't going to start a war with us, and Russia isn't going to start a war with us. You think the leaders of those countries want to put at risk their lavish, cushy lifestyle of power to try and prove a point to the United States? These people need to get real and get a clue.

Which is to say, they view themselves as victims of an illegitimate regime, and would be happy to see the US return the nation -by force- to the conditions under which they were prosperous, and regain lost property and wealth. 
Its understandable but one needs to confront that the reality  that most Iranians would certainly not want US intervention in regime change. That would likely result in a long and protracted civil war with outrageous suffering. Surely that is the worst possible outcome for Iranians. 

If I were Iranian, I can't imagine that I would view acts of war as positive developments no matter how i viewed the current Islamic state.

Is sunna or shia islam dominant in Iraq?
Is Iraq's PM shia (and thus cooperating with Iran regime)?
Why Sulemain was actually in Iraq?
What exactly are these 52 targets?

I disagree with our president's decision to assassinate Soleimani. There is a protocol he failed to follow and has hurt relations with our allies, and made a disgrace of what the institution of democracy stands for. Hopefully this situation gets better, but until he is out of office, it won't. These people aren't bad, they aren't bad, they just need education. There are those of us here, in America working to progress change. We fight ignorance one day at a time as best we can. However, fighting ignorance takes finesse. The democrats fuel the republican's ignorance. We have to realize that most of these people are terrified of things they don't understand and assume that they can just take other people at their word instead of researching things themselves. This ignorant culture isn't new. I believe better education of other cultures at a young age is a viable option to progressive change.

2. The anger about the assassination of Soleimani has mostly no correlation of him being ""good or bad""! It is mostly about how it was performed:  Soleimani got invited by the Iraqi government to mediate in peace talks when the US decided to murder him and not to mention the people who were right next to him. The USA murdered a high ranking official from a sovereign nation which is actually an act of war, WITHOUT a declaration of war! This whole act simply screams ""war-crime""! And this is what most people here KNOW about this. Most didn't know who  Soleimani was and what he did, but they know that he was a high ranking official of a sovereign nation on a peace mission that got murdered on the whim of Donald Trump.
3. Knowing all this, YOU SHOULD KNOW that most of these comments are in no way ignorant, because they mostly don't even deal with anything people need more information on, so they don't need to inform themselves more! We as outsiders have NO right to meddle with the internal affairs of other countries, so long they don't commit crimes against humanity... something the USA also should remember!

Lastly and as a bonus:  Soleimani  was by far no good guy, but and here is a big BUT he was one of the central figures in the fight AGAINST the IS in the last years. Credit where credit is due and I am SURE you did NOT know of this..."	ekad1u	2020-01-06 07:58:08

403	1578296005.0	One thing: The Language. The Middle East is among one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world and some are non-indicative of their region. It's not hard to imagine that some people who do not actively research these regions, might not understand the where the language barriers are. And this ends I even more complicated since it is written in a completely foreign script. Imagine if someone who only knows Farsi was asked which language Denmark speaks? Would they know they speak Danish, or might they confuse it with another Nordic Language? Or perhaps a West Germanic language? It's easy to judge for you as you have personal experience in the matter, but it's harder for average Joe to know what language a particular region speaks in an area with dozens of languages.	ekad1u	2020-01-06 08:33:25

2: before the Islamic revolution Iran was a centrepiece of what a Middle East country should look like. My father best friend was a Jewish boy who’s father owned a movie theatre and they would watch Bruce Lee movies together. 

3:The country is so diverse Iran hold some of the best ski resorts in the Middle East. Yes there deserts but there is also mountains, grass and snow. It’s a beautiful place and I would love to visit someday.

The IRI has improved in recent years. A new animated movie on Shahnameh was made called ""The Last Fiction"". Basiji has cooled down and lets many people drink alcohol in public. And much more.
Christians are treated well in Iran too. So many Armenian Churches and a respect to differences in belief. It is not difficult also to take a trip to Yazd and convert to Zoroastrianism who are a given a seat in parliament.
Soleimani was in Iraq so they could mediate peace negotiations with KSA. In fact, Trump asked for this, but then he had Soleimani killed like the coward he is. Soleimani fought ISIS and resisted USA plus Israeli imperialism. After this, Trump had the audacity to threaten the destruction of Iranian cultural sites.
Even before the Shah left his reign, he was becoming dissatisfied with USA, Israel, and UK. It is not in the interests of Iran to become pro-Western. The regime may have its faults, but it is improving. However, sanctions do not help anyone.
Iran is not the one attacking Western civilians. 9/11, Paris & Stockholm attacks, and much more were  Sunni fanatics.

I'm almost certain it borders Iraq? ..but I get your point.. sorry, a joke perhaps in poor taste. Couldn't help it.

Seriously though I dig what you're saying. Rampant cultural and intellectual deprivation in contemporary society angers me. It's shameful, embarrassing, pathetic.. just awful. Like when people go on holiday to a place they know the name of but don't actually know where it is or what continent it's in.. or in some cases they think the name of the place is the country so they think they're vacationing to the nation of Borneo or some shit.

More importantly than all that though you're educating people which is cool, and it's interesting stuff. I did not know that Iran has snowy mountains, lakes and lush forests. I am aware there are cheetahs in Iran.. possibly the only country in Asia in which they live in the wild.. so I guess it makes sense that there would be such diverse environments in Iran.

A lot of what you're saying is on point. Society is rampant with hypocrisy, double standards, generalisation the likes of which you're alluding to. So many bloody virtue signallers.. I mean in the west we've got this gratuitously biased mainstream media which virtue signals it's wokeness, liberal ideologies how politically correct it is, but similar to what you're saying at the same time the mainstream media also war mongers... 

And yeah there's too much extremity.. centralism seems to be dying. It's all either with us or them.. black or white (the metaphor.. not the race.. of course if I used this metaphor in the presence of an SJW I'd probably be called a racist), you're a liberal or a fascist or a.. nazi apparently. ANTIFA is a joke because they demonstrate fascist behaviour despite they are supposed to be anti-fascist.. and people are being called Nazis by these extreme SJW's for having a controversial opinion or having the audacity to question or criticise certain liberal ideologies. Everything should be criticised. Nothing should be immune to criticism that's dangerous and just.. awful.

This is all going off on a tangent and possibly politicising your post in a context that deviates from your subject, so I apologise for that it just come outta' me like.

I think bashing Trump for having the courage to do what others wanted to do but didn’t have the resolve to actually follow through, is hypocrisy. He did it to protect American lives and to help aide the Iranian people with their pursuit of democracy.

All we know about the Middle East is Afghanistan and Desert Storm and the Twin Towers and are pretty much brainwashed to think everyone from the Middle East (wherever that is) is a terrorist. Those who care about humanity understand that in every country and every nation, there are good people. People people who don’t want conflict and don’t want war and just want to live a good life. I am sorry for the ignorance that is coming to light. Just know that the internet is full of dumb shits like this, but we all don’t believe what we read and still hope for peace and not constant division based on ignorance.

The Middle East is the most generalized area of the world; and it’s only hurting us, Americans, more by not doing the work to understand the different identities, cultures and political perspectives of the millions of people in the “Middle East”. I used to be a nanny for an Egyptian family and my eyes were ripped open to the horrific amount of education American society has on the truths about social, cultural, religious, philosophical aspects of the people from most if not all ‘Middle Eastern’ nations. My best friend is Syrian and he also has explained so much of what you discussed... and every time I listen to him or his family I feel more frustrated with my prior ignorance towards such dynamic people and places- especially because I come from a family that prides itself on education and have reached to top educational tiers in my industry... but that goes to show why a post like yours is so important for so many people to read... it helps us pull our heads out of the sand and actually get a better idea of what true life is for nations we hear and talk about everyday.	ekad1u	2020-01-06 11:02:09

Yeah, most people are ignorant about Iran, and many people are talking out of their asses about the situation. I think many of us would prefer to never have to think about Iran like we never have to think about Turkmenistan or Namibia. We see no reason for there to be continuous conflict between our countries. And we were on a path away from that conflict, but instead we gave Iran more reason to distrust and fear us, and that has led us to the current escalating tensions.

These misconceptions aren’t particular to one party. Everybody does it and they don’t realize they are doing. However, I see that conservatives do it a bit more often because conservatives tend to be more religious, and with churches like WBC, the Mormons and the Jehovah’s witnesses, there is always Islamophobia which FUELS the hatred for the Middle East.

Also, this Islamophobia hurts other minorities as well such as the Sikhs. They wear hijabs and all of a sudden they’re Islam. Or, the Jews and anti-semitism... there have been a lot of hate crimes over these minorities recently for no justifiable reason."	ekad1u	2020-01-08 08:28:24

The US sided with Iran by essentially agreeing that Iran would take ownership of the refineries while a non-British company would get the right to extract from the oil fields, whilst the AIOC would get compensated through oil and money given to them by Iranian oil. In this conflict,  nobody is really allies.

If you have a chance, look up Rick Scott's video on his trip to Iran: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYoa9hI3CXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYoa9hI3CXg)"	ekad1u	2020-01-05 22:26:35

Whereas in reality, Saudi Arabia loathes them for being Shii'ite Muslims (Shii'ite is a sect within Islam that has some different views from Sunni Islam, which is the form of Islam most Muslims practice). Saudi Arabia despises Yemen for the same reason as well.	ekad1u	2020-01-05 22:28:24

I can still recite the national anthem, and have fond memories of the big blue mosque in Isfahan, I can still taste the amazing bread (complete with the occasional little stone in it), the food, the culture and history, everything really. The cynical, misguided and criminal attempt by Trump to deflect from his impeachment and to try and drum up support in an election year makes me sick. Yes the Iran of today is far from ideal politically and there is much fucked up stuff going on, but the people of Iran were almost always lovely, friendly and caring. Please understand if you are in Iran that the UK and it's people have no quarrel with you, we are all just people trying to get along under less than ideal governments - one day I hope to take my kids to Isfahan to do what I did, and sit round a howzs (spelling? small pool anyway) under the shade of the quince trees but sadly I don't see that being possible for a very long time, if ever.

I’ve been very vocal for years that Western Democracy doesn’t work within the Middle East, largely in part to the centuries old rift between Shiite and Sunni Muslims, and the Middle East is very insular and is known for keeping each other in check. 

As an American, I absolutely HATE how our government feels that it’s necessary to meddle in the affairs of others, all largely to keep money pumping into the military industrial complex, as many politicians have stocks in defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin. Acts of war are self serving.

Your family was fortunate to leave Iran, I’m assuming right after the revolution. I’m sure there were struggles in moving continents, but nothing as close as what local people went through because they had to stay. 

You have forgone power to make decisions of Iran’s internal affairs by leaving. Not just you, myself included. We are now spectators who are supporting our brothers and sisters in the country. We can’t impose what WE feel the direction of the country should be upon them. The locals don’t want another monarchy. They don’t want another revolution. They want stability and peace. Our nation been unsettled for the past 40-50 years.

People tend to align with the general consensus to avoid downvotes, thus a subconscious bias develops at people who reply here, but I honestly dgaf about that, here's my 2 cents take about the subject:

Every nation should be sovereign on thyself, and any foreign intervention should be countered with the necessary countermeasures. The US spread shit in the ME for decades now, and it's indirect war against Islam isn't stopping anytime soon. Their attack on Iran is unjustified and is, by the normal standards, a declaration of war to Iran. We humans have achieved advanced levels of civilization, and yet we repeat the same mistakes as before, we never learn... Does that mean this things should go by like nothing happened? No! There are international treaties, laws, and conventions that rule above all, and the US should be taken accountable to their actions, either by the norms, or as the oppressed deem just for them as long as they can.

Iran, in case of no retribution from the international court, have all rights to answer to this call of war. It is preferable to seek a more peaceful solution, but sometimes, war is a necessary evil. Even if us, those who are not directly concerned by the conflict, might be far from the coalition, still see the injustice in the american intervention, and that say nothing but ""maybe this time it's on Iran, as what happened to Iraq, Afghanistan and others, maybe next time it's our time"" and I dont want my kids to grow and face this same worldwide threat. I ask God (yeah, the one you disbelieve in) to give right to the oppressed, and punish the oppressor as he see just, and may he solve this issue in the most peaceful way.

>The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d'état (Persian: کودتای ۲۸ مرداد‎), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953,\[5\] orchestrated by **the United States** (under the name TPAJAX Project\[6\] or ""Operation Ajax"") and **the United Kingdom** (under the name ""Operation Boot"").\[7\]\[8\]\[9\]\[10\] **It was the first covert action of the United States to overthrow a foreign government during peacetime.**\[11\]

So you're pro-Shah but opposed to the anti-democratic British government... that installed the Shah after a coup to overthrow a democratically elected leader. And you're criticizing the evil anti-democratic British government, but you don't think the US government is evil, when it worked hand in hand with the UK to overthrow Mosaddegh. 

>Mosaddegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now part of BP) and to limit the company's control over Iranian oil reserves.\[12\] Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country.\[13\]\[14\]\[15\] After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically.\[16\] Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott\[17\] while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government.\[18\]:3 Judging Mosaddegh to be unreliable and fearing a Communist takeover in Iran, **UK prime minister Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the preceding Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement would set.**\[18\]:3 British intelligence officials' conclusions and the UK government's solicitations were instrumental in initiating and planning the coup, despite the fact that the U.S. government in 1952 had been considering unilateral action (without UK support) to assist the Mosaddegh government.\[19\]\[20\]\[21\]

Truman administration opposition had prevented the coup from going forward, but the Eisenhower administration allowed it. Which means the US government made the difference in whether the coup happened or not. And, in fact, the US government had planned to do it whether or not the UK helped at all. 

>Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king),\[22\] to rule more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power.\[13\]\[14\]\[15\]\[23\] According to the CIA's declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were **hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots** on 19 August.\[24\] Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city.\[25\] Between 200\[3\] and 300\[4\] people were killed because of the conflict. **Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court.** On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.\[26\]\[27\]\[28\] Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty.\[15\] **After the coup, the Shah continued his rule as monarch for the next 26 years**\[14\]\[15\] until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.\[14\]\[15\]\[18\]

Your pro-Shah family should absolutely *love* the anti-democratic practices of the UK **and** US governments, as without those, the Shah would just be a meaningless has-been. 

Redditors should absolutely know more about Iran, and about the role that international capitalism, the security state, and the imperial interests of the US and UK had in Iran's present condition.

You lost me hard on the paragraph where you scream ""I'm atheist, and f*ck arabs with their religion"" and speak like if you're the ultimate persian ambassador. You're not better than any other redditor or internet user who's anxious about the future of his nation and the whole world.

People tend to align with the general consensus to avoid downvotes, thus a subconscious bias develops at people who reply here, but I honestly dgaf about that, here's my 2 cents take about the subject:

Every nation should be sovereign on thyself, and any foreign intervention should be countered with the necessary countermeasures. The US spread shit in the ME for decades now, and it's indirect war against Islam isn't stopping anytime soon. Their attack on Iran is unjustified and is, by the normal standards, a declaration of war to Iran. We humans have achieved advanced levels of civilization, and yet we repeat the same mistakes as before, we never learn... Does that mean this things should go by like nothing happened? No! There are international treaties, laws, and conventions that rule above all, and the US should be taken accountable to their actions, either by the norms, or as the oppressed deem just for them as long as they can.

Iran, in case of no retribution from the international court, have all rights to answer to this call of war. It is preferable to seek a more peaceful solution, but sometimes, war is a necessary evil. Even if us, those who are not directly concerned by the conflict, might be far from the coalition, still see the injustice in the american intervention, and that say nothing but ""maybe this time it's on Iran, as what happened to Iraq, Afghanistan and others, maybe next time it's our time"" and I dont want my kids to grow and face this same worldwide threat. I ask God (yeah, the one you disbelieve in) to give right to the oppressed, and punish the oppressor as he see just, and may he solve this issue in the most peaceful way. Amene!"	ekad1u	2020-01-05 20:53:04

Unfortunately, many people are not ashamed of their ignorance.  

You can go through all sorts of subreddits, Yahoo Answers, Quora, and the like and find people that obviously have no clue what they’re talking about give answers with no admission that they know nothing about the topic.   

I even know people like this.  I’ve seen people give directions to the airport and they can’t even point in which direction the airport is.  When I called them out, they said, “Well, they’ll figure it out.  It’s their fault for not using Google Maps.”

Unfortunately, this problem is exacerbated by access to knowledge.  What language do Iranians speak?  Hmmm, let me look this up on Google.  I can’t be bothered to read this long article but the snippet on the search engine results page says Farsi so I’m going to post that using an authoritative tone so people will think I’m smart.  “It’s a well known fact that . . . “ 

As my username might suggest, I live in Thailand (as an expat), and it boggles my mind when I see some travel vlogger break down Thailand or Thai culture after spending 2 weeks here.  I’ve been traveling to Thailand since the early 2000’s and lived in Thailand for several years and my wife is Thai, and still don’t understand everything about Thai culture.  But some guy that came here for two weeks and spent all his time at a resort and doing taking boat trips to all of the tourist islands has it all figured out?  LOL

In this day and age, it’s hard for people to just say, “I don’t know” or to sit back and let other people with knowledge about the topic educate them while they stay respectfully quiet.  They think that by doing a quick Google search that they’re helping but they don’t fully grasp the fact that there are actual Iranians that can provide more insight than their Google search.  

I don’t expect someone to know all of the nuances on why a war broke out between Slovakia and Hungary but maybe they shouldn’t try to comment and use it as an opportunity to be educated on the topic.

It wouldn't be a problem if we as Americans weren't constantly talking out of our ass' and loudly proclaiming opinions about topics we've often done little to attain even a cursory knowledge of.

It's amazing how many people don't even take the most basic steps to cross check their sources... 

My experience of genuine Iranians? I knew a family at university who had fled the Shah to the UK; the daughter often recounted the trauma of watching her mother be tortured, and threatened with rape in front of her by the Shah's secret police, whilst an attache from the CIA was stood nearby apparently. True? False?  You can so very, very easily go to the history books and see what the Shah was *really* like, however.

It's true that the United Kingdom is widely hated in Iran. Because as the comment I'm responding too points out, *we forced the Shah on them because we refused to let them nationalise the oil within their own lands*.

Anyone with common sense and a little knowledge of history knows how the last draft went and that it ain't likely to happen again for several reasons.

First of all, the economy will tank if we enter a third word war. When the economy is down, military enlistment soars

Second of all, young people are the ones affectsd by a draft. Young people are overwhelmingly democrat. The democrats control the house. House approval is required for a draft. The Dems are not going to risk their voter base by drafting the kids who support them.

Third, this is not going to lead to a war so big that our current military cannot handle it.

Sadly, really just the west has decent infrastructure and rule of law, and lack of corruption

I saw another post yesterday where someone explained that the death to America mobs are a minority and that nobody there wants a war over there but the media again likes to portray a different image. 

 It’s horribly sad because between it all, there’s those of us who are likeminded on both sides of the debate, who seek truth and find common ground on what we stand for and believe. There’s those of us who can look past a religious belief and coexist with peace and respect - but those who can’t are the vocal ones.

As OP notes, not everyone is behind the government there.

Iraq is actually doing themselves a favor by expelling US troops. They are both stating their neutrality and removing most of the potential reasons for Iran to start attacking them.

No Americans were hurt and the mob never actually made it onto the primary Embassy grounds. The Marines at the Embassy guarded it without even having to shoot at the mob.

Did the Iranian leadership brag about it? No--they said they weren't responsible--just the mob itself and other Iranians were bragging...which doesn't mean the Iranian government wasn't involved of course--but there's not evidence they were involved as of yet.

Based on all that...I think the American response is too strong...I think we were waiting for any small opportunity to go after Iran and we took it. 0 casualties from the Embassy attack and it appears to be an emotional citizen-response to the recent December 29th American bombings?

946	1578277148.0	I think the point of the OP is that it makes no sense that people get the two languages mixed up. Iran is not even an Arab country, but you say middle east and most people think every single one is Arab.	ekad1u	2020-01-06 03:19:08

First of all, if you ever visited Iran make sure to find a good restaurant. More costumers *usually* means better and healthier food. Also I advise you to talk to tourists who have been in Iran before (if you know of them). Unfortunately if you get food poisoning, there's not much you can do. 







One of the foods that Iran is really famous for is Ghormeh Sabzi. It's a combination of meat, fenugreek, rice, dried lemon and bean. I don't recommend googling this food because the actual food looks much better than all of the pictures of it on Google. 








One of the other foods that I personally really like is Gheimeh. This one is a combination of meat, dried lemon, rice, french fries and split pea. 









Kebabs are good too(literally any type of Kebab)







If you visited Iran in Autumn and if you had the chance to visit northern states of Iran (the ones around Caspian/Khazar sea), make sure to try Caspian Kutum/Mahi Sefid (it translates to white fish) 










However if you don't like any of those foods, you can  find Italian restaurants or steak houses. They're specially easier to find in bigger cities. Such as Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan or Tabriz (my city)"	ekad1u	2020-01-07 02:48:00

I'm not going to disagree with you on how religious minorities are being mistreated in Iran. I'm not gonna deny what happens to LGBT people in Iran and how they can't express themselves (an extremely unpopular opinion but I'm perfectly fine with LGBT activities being banned in Iran because I can see how this community acts in western countries. All it takes for you to be considered a homophobic or a transphobic is saying one negative thing about LGBT community and then you're done. We have much bigger fishes to fry here in Iran than to be worried about about the problems of a minority that hardly even exists in our country. I used to defend their rights at every opportunity but now this community is just being extreme and as long as they act like cult members and religious fanatics, I'm not going to lift a finger for them. Being part of a minority group doesn't justify shitty behavior)






60% of murder cases in Iran are about women killing their own husbands. Meaning the most dangerous place for a man in Iran is somewhere next to his wife. This is a simple fact that I'm 100% sure that neither of you Americans or your moraly right Hollywood celebrities are going to talk about let alone to accepting it. 










Here in Iran, men have been falsely accused of sexual harassment by women decades before #metoo movement was even a thing






Women in Iran have their own special seats in busses and metro which men aren't allowed to use. They even have their own special park where men aren't allowed. 







If you divorce your wife in America you're gonna lose half of your belongings? That's cute because in Iran not only there's a 99% chance that you will lose ALL of your money and belongings but your parents might lose a considerable amount of money as well. Not to mention how you're probably gonna spend couple of months or years in jail

Well, you heard wrong. There's only one sexist rule against women in Iran and that's how they're forced to wear hijab. And truth be told, that rule isn't being taken seriously anymore.

Iran is a country FILLED with corruption. Literally all and every single one of our politicians are corrupt and all this corruptions have destroyed the country. If our politicians stop being corrupt and start doing their actual jobs, things would start getting better. But since they're too busy filling their pockets, not only the corruption will continue but also someone else will be blamed for all of our problems. Someone outside the borders of Iran and right now US (America's president to be more specific) is the perfect candidate for that. Matter of fact, this is exactly what our government has been doing in the past 40 years. Every US president has been addressed as the ""sworn enemy of Iranian people"" in the past 40 years by our media and politicans. What I'm trying to say is that Iran *needs* a villain. Let's assume that the Iran/US war actually starts and Iran wins the war (Iran can never win an all out war against US. Even if other countries don't side with US, considering how we managed to piss off a fair amount of countries in the past 40 years. You can hardly find a country that doesn't hate us). What do you think happens next? Every single one of Iranian people's problems will be solved? Nope. Immediately afterwards, Iran will start looking for another villain to put the blame on. This new villain is probably going to be Israel, England or maybe France. 










3 years ago Iran and US had some sort of peace treaty when Obama was the president. Do you think it solved our problems? Not only it solved nothing but also what Obama did was pretty much like putting the sheeps(Iranian people) and wolves(our government) in the same cage. It just gave our government more power and they used that power to be more corrupt. And honestly, I hate Obama and your left wing for that and I also know that I'm not the only one who feels that way. I'm not supporting Trump's decision tho. After all, he assassinated Iran's golden boy (even though I hated that guy with every single fiber of my heart). Iran definitely won't stay silent. When you think about it, this can also be a clear message from US and Iran sure as hell got the message. And the message reads ""get your troops out from middle east, Iran"". This can also start another war in middle east and Trump probably won't stop until he makes sure that Iran won't try anything funny in middle east anymore"	ekad1u	2020-01-06 01:58:20

The government instituted a strict media censorship, shutting down left wing media. Several journalists have been victims of violence or censorship by the government or related groups.

Ive seen threads suggesting we carpet bomb the country and dont occupy, trump announced a plan to destroy cultural sites if there is retaliation, and frankly we had a pseudo peace about 3 years ago.




I get that theres multiple perspectives on the matter in iran and the Iranian community.  However, there also is in the US, and the support for drudging in another war is relatively low.  So, your seeing a combination of anger, fear, uncertainty, resentment and actual probable hatred (at either the iranians, or the us, or just everyone) manifest into memes.

I think your problem stems from the fact that you're making Iran out to be more important than it actually is.

 Has Iran made any meaningful contribution to modern international culture? (no) Is Iran a place where lots of western visitors travel? (no) Is the culture, language or religion similar in any way to western countries? (no).

People would see my notes from class and immediately assume Arabic.  I can't blame them for that, but I would try to explain that the Arabic alphabet is used to write 100s of langauges, like the Roman alphabet is for English, German, French, Polish, Swahili, etc.

People are making stupid comments as if they are experts, when in reality they know NOTHING about the country at all.  I wrote a facebook post in Farsi saying ""let there be no war"" and I had an army guy post things about Arabs / Arabic.  I tried to explain they spoke Farsi and then he posted an encyclopeida article he himself misread and stated it was proof Iranians spoke Arabic.

Everyone's scared about WWIII.  they only have 500,000 soldiers while we have most 3,500,000 soldiers.  our military literally has entire warehouses full of weapons of war just waiting to be used, and if they decide to nuke.  The most it'll damage is about a 20-30 mile radius.  It's still a lot, but compared to our war heads, we shouldn't have to worry.  I say all of this because if people actually did the research, they'd know that Iran really isn't that big of a deal.  But this still begs the question.  Why did the US kill that general?

2. I’m sure people understand there were exceptions, there must have been certain cases where protesters were instigator - seeing them in magnifying glass might not help the over all target of supporting protesters.
3. Redditors are not judges - they are just like people driving by an accident in freeway. They look at it, make a quick assumption and comment. They are not involved. Just lip service.

Unfortunately, there are people (like you) who is deeply sentimentally, emotionally linked to the incident. It would help you if remember that - redditors are just paser by. They know nothing.

Biggest side effect is , paasers by form opinion over time and it magnifies certain news items to its peak , after all you need to do is retweet or upvote an item. This creates undue attention than other topics that needs attention.

Once they were added to the list the US is officially at war with them based on the policy from post 9/11 when we declared a war on Terror. From the day the IRG was added to that list, its leaders and members were officially ""targets of opportunity"" meaning that given the opportunity to kill them and destroy their means to wage terror, we would act and kill them.

Opportunity presented itself, and we acted. Rumor is that the intelligence leading to the attack came from Saudi Arabia...who were just attacked in their largest refineries last month by Iran.  Trump and the US military needed no authorization from Congress to make this attack...we did not need to declare war...we were already at war with every organization on the list of known terrorists.

All this liberal media disinformation about not notifying congress etc is a willfull attempt by the MSM to mislead Americans and the world....they know full well that the IRG is a known terrorist organization that can be lawfully attacked at any time.  Most Iranians are glad that we did so....as recently as the 1970s Iran had a society very similar to the West...secular...before they were ov3taken by an oppressive muslim regime.

We have no quarrel with the Iranian citizens. We have not declared war on Iran as a country.  We ARE at war with every known terrorist organization on EARTH and will kill them when we can. If and when Iran attacks the US or Israel we will meet them with overwhelming force...however the US will never attempt to occupy or ""liberate"" Iran. There will be no ground war in Iran.  If they strike American or Israeli forces however...there will be Tomahawk cruise missiles, drone attacks, and overwhelming air power to destroy their military facilities and their ability to wage war. Fortunately we have Smart Weapons now...which are very accurate and minimize civilian casualties as much as possible.

We have no quarrel with citizens. If they do not want war like their oppressive leaders do...they should let their voices be heard at home and revolt...only they can change their government. The US is not going to change it for them."	ekad1u	2020-01-06 00:52:31

Back in the day with print, it was basically a page of OP-ED and editorials and clearly posted as such. Maybe it’s the fault of cable journalism. Having it all day every day.

Reddit is a fantastic example of people who follow clickbait like journalism or Facebook or whatever and it story just gets diluted with junk.

Not saying it shouldn’t happen but how on earth is a spending bill related to smoking!?), one party says no, and the other party says you don’t care about education or welfare, and the media doesn’t report that...I have an issue.

I’m not in any way saying this is your intention (and you’re not the only person saying this - primarily because the statement is obviously true to at least some extent - if for no reason other than 80+ million people will never entirely agree with one another), but it’s definitely concerning to me that these sorts of comments will eventually snowball into justification for other actions.

You know I don't know much about Hillary Clinton or what she did in the past and honestly, right now I'm too busy to do a research about a former politican who lives in another country across the ocean. All I know about her and the things that I'm sure are 100% true about her are her actions prior to 2016 election. Technically she had nothing to offer and all she did was taking pictures with Hollywood celebs and giving speeches that were all about gender talks. I wasn't surprised to see she lost the election. 






>I don't think Obama was a good president for any part the Middle East. He claimed to be a good guy, but his actions said very different things. 







""Hey there, I'm a good guy ""




-SAID NO ACTUAL GOOD GUY EVER 








Because people who actually have the right morals don't feel the need to asked to be praised by others at any given opportunity 






I even remember how he sent a new year message to Iran (he even spoke Persian in some parts of his message) but like you said, his actions proved otherwise. 






> also don't think we should be involved in the change that needs to happen in Iran. Shouldn't change come within?







I absolutely agree with you on this one. There's this book about Iran's history that explains how prior to Muslim invasion that happened 1400 years ago in Iran, people grew tired of fighting Roman empire and poor economics. It was so bad that people were willing to do literally anything to overthrow Iran's government back then. So people betrayed the King and started siding with Arabs/Muslims which resulted a massive cultural erasure that lasted for 2 centuries and after 14 centuries, we are still dealing with it's consequences. 






Unfortunately, the history is repeating itself. People have grown sick of the current government and some people would do anything to get rid of this regime 




Anytime that a foreign power started getting involved in our businesses things ended even worse than before for our people. After all, it's not like that foreigners started doing ""favors"" for us because of kindness of heart 







>I'd wager that a portion of Iran's current problems are due to foreign influence, why would it suddenly be a different story?








90% of our problems have been caused by out useless politicans and their corruptions. But the same mentioned corrupt politicians are acting as if all of this is caused by America and Israel 







>maybe a small portion of that but most definitely not all of it









>Do you really think anything Trump does will be good for the country?









Before becoming the president of US, Trump was a businessman and he was a successful one. I'm no business expert but I'm almost 100% confident that you don't get to be a successful businessman by doing favors for others for free. So it would be extremely foolish to say that Trump just wants to help us overthrow our government because he's a good man

Iran was a quickly modernizing nation before the democratic government of Mossadegh was deposed and the Shah took over. The Islamic Revolution was just a continuation of the decline that started with the 1953 revolution.

Edit: Before you downvote, [read up](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat). In 1953 the secular democratic Iranian government was overthrown and the Shah was returned from exile and reinstated with increased authority.

Hmong people and many other ethnicities are just another example of the “US trying to control the situation.” Hmong people would never be in the US if the US CIA had not secretly supplied and trained up child soldiers to fight for their agendas. 

After they were done with us, they relied on the Christian conservatives (who are honestly willing to help their neighbors but to their own default) to sponsor us and help us settle into society. This seems honorable however if you see how experienced the US is at bringing in more and more immigrants in, you’d start to wonder why.

I have some bitter sweet feelings and conclusion about the outcome. I am happy to be in the US for other reasons but not due to the situation. I am also glad to be a believer in Jesus because he has moved in my life regardless of the Christian sponsorship influences. This is not to belittle their willing principals but just my testament as to Jesus working in my life. 

However we are here now and the US is still the same guy we learned about from the Vietnam War. So when people cry about allowing just any immigrant safe or dangerous to enter the US I can see why they would assume all is well. However I had to come legally and being a child of war it’s the Christian conservatives who actually took us immigrants in and taught us, not raging left nor the Government. The gov. was a mere part of the process but without the love and help of the church and my Grandma who was able to come to the US first and save enough money to also help us, we would have suffered more. I know this because many has to settle in the tougher neighborhoods of bigger cities. We were fortunate to settle in a suburban small town with the population of less than 15k. My story though ordinary is hopefully a small window for those who care enough to understand. 

I say all this to say I really believe all that’s happening is really messed up. However when I see people complaining over the POTUS and how “terrible” the US that they would want to move but never do for whatever reason. It’s really just extra noise. Just be glad for what you have and focus on how we can come together to make progress. Rather then cut each other’s throats, focus on regulating our government so they have less power to be ambiguous and do harm. 

Americans are so spoiled that they get the luxury to complain about politics rather then worry about being hunted down for simply wanting to exists. Getting mad at politics and propaganda is understandable however it will never solve the real issues in this world. People are so easily jerked by emotions and forget as quickly as they learn.

1430	1578266873.0	"That's not even close to accurate. Did someone actually teach you this nonsense, or did you make it up entirely by yourself?

The electoral college exists so that large states can't overwhelm the wishes of those living in smaller states. It was designed that way on purpose: the United States wouldn't exist at all without it. When the colonies came together, the smaller states were afraid of exactly what the ""most votes win"" crowd wants: that the desires of major population centers like NYC and LA would dictate what happens in Kansas without Kansas getting a say in it. And guess what the population of those larger states *still* wants to do more than 200 years later?

As far as ""who got the most votes,"" that also is a ridiculous statement. People turn out the way they do precisely because of the way the system is designed. For example, if you live in California and you want the Democrat to win, you don't really need to go to the polls: the Democrat is going to win whether you take the time out of your day to vote or not. And the same goes for almost any red state in the opposite direction. Only those who are most passionate or are doing it out of a sense of civic duty are actually going to the polls, so looking at the raw vote totals is precisely the wrong way to gauge public opinion.

I could go on, but I think I've made my point: you're wrong on many levels, so perhaps you should save your opinion-making until you better understand the thing you're forming your opinion about."	ekad1u	2020-01-06 00:27:53

All political groups should be vehicles for policy goals, when it becomes your social community then that is when shit goes out the window.

You do you, dont be a cocksucker about it, and admit when your wrong.


Otherwise its more of a religion than it is a political leaning.  And for life of me, dont treat parties like you treat your beliefs.  Its fine to feel strongly about something, just dont put the label ahead of the idea.


And for the love of god, not everything is political.

There doesn't need to be.  They need to be notified is all.

The Executive can order limited military strikes on an as-needed basis. Under the War Powers Act the President can take unilateral military action without congressional approval. However, there are caveats to using that power.

1. There must be a  ""A Clear and Present Danger To The United States""
2. Must get congressional approval within 60 days of initiation of military action or cease all military action.

/Part of the above was shamelessly stolen from a Quora answer, fwiw

People seem to have some false impression that Congress is In Charge of Everything^^TM which isn't helped along by the rhetoric of Congress itself(namely the House[See Below] which is currently in opposition to everything Trump does).

The Executive branch is definitively in charge of a LOT of things, including the military, and isn't answerable to congress except in certain specific ways.  The whole purpose of separation of powers is so that no one body can make the other useless.

>And isn’t Congress more R dominated?

No.  Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The House is Democrat dominated at the moment.  The Senate is not.

>Or was the approval for military actions in Iraq from years ago?

#This section gets quite long, because it goes into some detail about the Middle East(mostly relevant to these recent events, but some generalities as well)  Intricate, so it's tough to TL;DR

Considering the above, this can get a bit murky depending on who you ask, however:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Iraq_(2014%E2%80%93present)

Note:  Thought the article uses the term ""invade"", we're there in cooperation with Iraq.  It's not a war against Iraq.  It's a war against terrorist forces, which was mostly winding down as ISIS lost pretty much all holdings in Iraq.

However, here's where it gets tricky.  ISIS aren't the only terrorist forces, aren't the only thing trying to subvert more democratically oriented people and/or governments(as in the most general sense, normal people who don't want to be under tyranny from religion or government which are often intertwined in the middle east, they might want Democracy, but some might settle for a little peace for a while via monarchy because anything's better than tyranny).

The first major name that was taken out in recent strikes is something of all of these.  Despite having extensively fought ISIS in the past, as of at least 2007, this guy has been doing so much more, meddling in many countries, seemingly on behalf of, or beside, other extremist factions which Iran is tied to.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani#Sanctions

For the past 12 years this guy had his hands in oppression of the people and being sympathetic to terrorists/Tyrannical-governments in many countries, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq.  Some of the other targets aren't much different.

There's a whole lot of complex context of what's going on over there currently.  Here's a brief list of involved parties for context above:

1. Tyrannical governments.  Syria currently has one.  Commonly carries out military attacks on it's own people, allegedly chemical attacks as well, which is why the US bombed an airstrip of theirs in 2017.  Iran militia(what Soleimani was), is sympathetic and has been helping them for years.

2. Religious extremists, terrorists([too many to name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_designated_terrorist_groups), but the current dominant players in relation to these current events).  ISIS/ISIL used to hold fully 1/3 of Iraq, which is why the US was there helping the Iraq government.  Hezbollah is another terrorist group, these are very friendly with the Iranian government, but were allied against ISIS/ISIL.  Now that ISIS is all but gone from Iraq, Hezbollah seems to be returning to it's roots.

3. Normal people, who just want a more or less fair society without oppression/control.

1 & 2 both want control over 3.

Ostensibly, 3 might be the bulk of the population, but they're not the ones in power in most of the countries, that's the Extremists and/or Tyrants(they're not mutually exclusive).  I'm not too caught up on the other countries specifically(Yemen, for example), but Iraq leadership seems to be of group 3.  Syria and Iran fall into some mixture of 1&2, attacking their own, attacking in other countries, etc.

This is what came of the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring).  In short, it was people across many countries rising up against 1&2, but the bad part is, 2&3 sometimes were allied against 1, and then 2 exerts dominance.

To make matters worse, even some of 3 simply want their turn at the wheel, to treat others badly like what was done to them, they can, in essence turn into 1 and/or 2.

It becomes a perpetual problem, history repeating itself.  What makes the Middle East unique from the rest of the world is that it's so rapid.  We see hints of it even in the US, but with a really strong constitution, it takes a societal shifting, instead of open displays of power and violence, but it's still present in various shades, it's just incredibly slow and subtle in comparison.

The US has an advantage, a constitution and other structure that was developed when the nation was young, this was done by group 3 with the specific intent of limiting government and even religious abuse."	ekad1u	2020-01-07 19:22:27

First, Tiananmen Square *was* free speech. It was an illegal assembly. Second, the amount of people who were actually protesting for ideological reasons were largely limited to the organizers. The majority of protesters were not organizers. Third, the main reason why so many protesters assembled is because the masses were angry about the disappearing iron rice bowl jobs combined with the lack of money a lot of college students had. They were living depressing lives with no guarantee of future and that made them really pissed off.

>The government never addressed the concerns of the protests

The government promised the people development and followed through. The decades following the 1980s were full of promise, and now Chinese are the fastest socioeconomic climbers in the world, much better off than Americans.

>The people were assembling peacefully until the government mercilessly crushed them with the military. The military acted first.

Many members of the CCP were highly opposed to deploying the PLA. It was employed as a definitive solution to protect the CCP-controlled state. The PLA expected that they would be received warmly as they showed up to tell a bunch of rambunctious children to go home and then everything would be over with and people could go back to their peaceful lives. They were surprised at how poorly they were received: many civilians spat and cursed at them for following orders.

The Senate only tries the articles for indictment, but the process of impeachment is reserved strictly to the House. Impeachment is the first step in the removal of a president from office, and just like confirming a Supreme Court justice during an election year, there is no legal precedent for when a trial had to take place. The Constitution doesn’t dictate that impeachment must be immediately followed by a trial or if the trial even needs to occur. Again, the process of impeachment is over and done with once it passes the house, the process of REMOVING a president is not. 

Given that McConnell and Graham went out of their way to publicly declare that, as jurors, they will be coordinating with the President, they have given a public notice that they will be denying their constitutional duties of a “fair and impartial jury” during the trial of impeachment articles and therefore have given Pelosi all the formal reason to postpone the trial until they recuse themselves. If they had kept their mouths shut, she might have a more difficult time, but they freely gave them all the reason to formally postpone.

One of the major reasons for the current (and relatively recent past) US strength is that all oil all over the world is bought and sold on the dollar.  Every oil drop, from every country (except Venezuela I think) is bought and sold with US Currency.  Why does this matter? Because, if you want to buy oil you need to buy US currency first. So like lets say Qatar makes 1 oil and Finland wants to buy it, Finland needs to buy / convert to USD and then buy the oil. Qatar gets the benefit of a higher cost for that oil (since it's not listed in Qatar currency) and the US gets the benefit since Finland bought/converted to it's currency.  Don't underestimate how incredibly important this is to the US and world economy, if countries try to leave the US oil dollar we usually go to war with them.

Article I, Sec 2, Clause 5: The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.


Article I, Sec 3, Clauses 6-7: The Senate shall have the sole power to TRY all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside. And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.

Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.

The Senate tries the articles of impeachment to determine if they are enough to remove from office, but the articles are already drafted. That’s what a trial is: you TRYING the articles presented before you. Trump is impeached, no matter when the Senate hears it (and they will, but it may not be until later.

1696	1578348446.0	"According to the Constitution, impeachment is a process, not a vote:

“If the House does not communicate its impeachment to the Senate, it hasn’t actually impeached the president. If the articles are not transmitted, Trump could legitimately say that he wasn’t truly impeached at all.

“The Constitution doesn’t say how fast the articles must go to the Senate. Some modest delay is not inconsistent with the Constitution, or how both chambers usually work.

But an indefinite delay would pose a serious problem. 

**Impeachment as contemplated by the Constitution does not consist merely of the vote by the House, but of the process of sending the articles to the Senate for trial. Both parts are necessary to make an impeachment under the Constitution: The House must actually send the articles and send managers to the Senate to prosecute the impeachment. And the Senate must actually hold a trial.**

Yeah, awkward. Now, we have liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz writing about how a recent Supreme Court just “ripped the rug” from under part of the Democrats’ impeachment nonsense concerning subpoenas:

“The decision by the Supreme Court to review the lower court rulings involving congressional and prosecution subpoenas directed toward President Trump undercuts the second article of impeachment that passed the House Judiciary Committee along party lines…

“That second article of impeachment charges President Trump with obstruction of Congress for refusing to comply with the congressional subpoenas in the absence of a final court order. In so charging him, the House Judiciary Committee has arrogated to itself the power to decide the validity of subpoenas, and the power to determine whether claims of executive privilege must be recognized, both authorities that properly belong with the judicial branch of our government, not the legislative branch. The House of Representatives will do likewise, when it votes to approve the articles, as the chamber is expected to do so Wednesday.

“President Trump has asserted that the executive branch, of which he is the head, need not comply with congressional subpoenas requiring the production of privileged executive material, unless there is a final court order compelling such production. He has argued, appropriately, that the judicial branch is the ultimate arbiter of conflicts between the legislative and executive branches. Therefore, the Supreme Court decision to review these three cases, in which lower courts ruled against President Trump, provides support for his constitutional arguments in the investigation.

[…]

**Even if the high court were eventually to rule against the claims by President Trump, the fact that the justices decided to hear them, in effect, supports his constitutional contention that he had the right to challenge congressional subpoenas in court, or to demand that those issuing the subpoenas seek to enforce them through court.

**It undercuts the contention by House Democrats that President Trump committed an impeachable offense by insisting on a court order before sending possibly privileged material to Congress.

[…]

**The first article goes too far in authorizing impeachment based on the vague criterion of abuse of power. But it is the second article that truly endangers our system of checks and balances and the important role of the courts as the umpires between the legislative and executive branches under the Constitution.**

I’ll say it again: I have no patience for idiot trump supporters who spew disinformation and proudly say MAGA 2020 like Russian pawns. I’ll stand by that to the day I die. Trump is clearly a disaster of a president and it doesn’t take a genius to see it.  The world is laughing at us.

Second.. that was me responding to your psychiatry bullshit. Just giving you an idea of what you’re up against. Most magafreaks I see are on the internet in scooters wandering through Walmart so I just assume you’re that. Your mind is clearly weak but that’s another story.

from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition.

noun One who is strongly partial to one's own group, religion, race, or politics and is intolerant of those who differ.

Here’s the definition again since you seem to need it. Calling someone worthless is not apart of that definition. What is, your views towards Trump supports. You say some evil shit in your comment history.

Your Walmart comment is called stereotyping, another thing hateful bigots and uneducated people do. You are just checking the boxes. 

All I did was look at your post history, which you did to mine. Yours is a lot more neck beard though. Lots of hate, porn, games, and general neck beard things.

All of this is due in large part to our unaffordable healthcare system and massive bubble of student loan debt. But you’re educated right? You know this stuff?

What’s your background in economics and tax law that makes you so worried about our country? Do you realize that you got a tax cut? Do you know how debt to GDP works? Do you think the homeless are dying on the street? Do you think the ACA made healthcare cheaper? When did the student loan debt bubble start? How the fuck do you blame this all on Trump? 

Yes I know everything you just mentioned, better than you I guarantee it. 

Trump is trying and is brining jobs back to the US so people can work and not be homeless. Increases competition for work means higher pay, which we are also seeing. When people make more money, they have more to spend, increasing our economy. 

The student loan debt and healthcare were a mess before Trump. For being a President for only 3 years so far, he can only do so much. I’m hopeful in the next 5 years he will get to infrastructure and healthcare, and maybe legalized weed. Student debt loans are an entirely different animal. 

You say you care about the GDP and debt levels so answer me how will the Dems pay for free healthcare and free college for the 350 million people in the US. If you just say raise taxes on the rich, I will know you have no idea what you are talking about.

I’ve taken college level courses on micro/ macro economics ... as well as more advanced finance courses. It was needed for my degree. It doesn’t take an expert to see the issue at hand. And you have made it clear you don’t have a real grasp on what’s going on in this Country.
You’re out of touch. In a bubble of stupidity.

Flint Michigan can’t Afford to pay for the issue. The point is they have an emergency on their hands and trump is focused on his stupid wall... which won’t do anything btw. Again... trumpies eat it up like catnip and do it proudly. With what we know now he should absolutely be sending aid to them.. but that was just one example I listed that you’re all hung up on.

It. Do we let it just continue ?

Flint Michigan was and is ran by corrupt Democrat’s that funneled funds used to fix their problem to PACs. The State of Michigan is also responsible for its cities and the those Democrats failed too. Yet you blame Trump. It’s fucking amazing. Even Obama could have gave them money but didn’t...

Also if you recall, I mentioned Trump has infrastructure plans after the 2020 election. You may get Flint fixed after all. 

I know it’s tough for you to understand, but as I said earlier I was once a moderate Democrat.  I cannot respect the way you and the people like you handle those without far left views.
