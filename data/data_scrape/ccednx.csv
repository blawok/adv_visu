8	1562996661.0	"Didn't Congress already pass the [War Powers Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) back in 1973 that deals exclusively with this issue?

> The War Powers Resolution (also known as the War Powers Resolution of 1973 or the War Powers Act) (50 U.S.C. 1541–1548) is **""a federal law intended to check the president's power to commit the United States to an armed conflict without the consent of the U.S. Congress.** The Resolution was adopted in the form of a United States Congress joint resolution. It provides that **the U.S. President can send the Armed Forces into action abroad only by declaration of war by Congress, ""statutory authorization,"" or in case of ""a national emergency created by attack upon the United States**, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.""

> The War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a further 30-day withdrawal period, without a Congressional authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a declaration of war by the United States. **The resolution was passed by two-thirds of each of the House and Senate, overriding the veto of the bill from President Nixon.**

So the first time didn't work it seems, and even Clinton is accused of violating it, yet there were no repercussions on his part. You could also say that Bush and Obama violated it as well.

> It has been alleged that the War Powers Resolution has been violated in the past – for example, by President Bill Clinton in 1999, during the bombing campaign in Kosovo. Congress has disapproved all such incidents, but none has resulted in any successful legal actions being taken against the president for alleged violations.

This isn't a failure of a law, this is a failure on part of Congress and not holding the President accountable to the law they passed."	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:44:21

Take a wild guess how much that's been abused since it's been passed. They should repeal the whole fucking thing and not just asked this for Iran. Bush abused the shit out of it, Obama abused the shit out of it. It's power the executive branch should not be able to abuse. Give the right to declare war BACK to CONGRESS.

19	1563005672.0	"Interesting ... but, unfortunately, I fear this is more ""Wag the Dog"" politics, as this is ***also*** outside of Congressional Powers (not to mention, Trump is ***surely*** going to veto this, should it cross his desk ... and it doesn't quite appear that the House has the 2/3rds majority that will be required to override the veto).

Even that, the US Constitution grants the sitting President certain powers over the military, completely exempt from Congressional oversight. Note that **both** Presidents Obama and Clinton used these very same ""powers,"" even above and beyond the ""War Powers Act,"" to wage their own operations without Congressional approval (read: technically, they violated Acts / Laws already on the books, beyond what's specified in the US Constitution, and suffered ***no*** repercussions from such actions).

Even over and above all of that... should this somehow pass in to law, it will likely be struck down as unconstitutional, as it specifically strikes against powers granted to the sitting US President. For this to work, it's going to have to become an amendment ... a simple ""act"" or ""law"" is going to end up being in-vein, and ignored, and give us even more fodder to argue about across the imaginary divisionary lines.

TLDR: this is only a ""political"" stunt, designed to get / keep people and press arguing with each other. It won't fly, despite it likely being a good idea."	ccednx	2019-07-13 10:14:32

From the Wiki. 



	Libya, 2011	
Edit
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified to Congress in March 2011 that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya or for further decisions about it, despite congressional objections from members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution.[10][11] During that classified briefing, she reportedly indicated that the administration would sidestep the Resolution's provision regarding a 60-day limit on unauthorized military actions.[12] Months later, she stated that, with respect to the military operation in Libya, the United States was still flying a quarter of the sorties, and the New York Times reported that, while many presidents had bypassed other sections of the War Powers Resolution, there was little precedent for exceeding the 60-day statutory limit on unauthorized military actions – a limit which the Justice Department had said in 1980 was constitutional.[13][14] The State Department publicly took the position in June 2011 that there was no ""hostility"" in Libya within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution, contrary to legal interpretations in 2011 by the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.[15][16][17]

May 20, 2011, marked the 60th day of US combat in Libya (as part of the UN resolution) but the deadline arrived without President Obama seeking specific authorization from the US Congress.[18] President Obama notified Congress that no authorization was needed,[19] since the US leadership had been transferred to NATO,[20] and since US involvement was somewhat ""limited"". In fact, as of April 28, 2011, the US had conducted 75 percent of all aerial refueling sorties, supplied 70 percent of the operation's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and contributed 24 percent of the total aircraft used in the operation.[21] By September, the US had conducted 26 percent of all military sorties, contributing more resources to Operation Unified Protector than any other NATO country.[22] The State Department requested (but never received) express congressional authorization.[16][23]

On Friday, June 3, 2011, the US House of Representatives voted to rebuke President Obama for maintaining an American presence in the NATO operations in Libya, which they considered a violation of the War Powers Resolution.[24][25] In The New York Times, an opinion piece by Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackerman stated that Obama's position ""lacks a solid legal foundation. And by adopting it, the White House has shattered the traditional legal process the executive branch has developed to sustain the rule of law over the past 75 years.""[26]



Let's hope President Trump keeps his record going, of being the first president since Carter to not invade another country. 



Even though we may disagree on most things, hopefully we can all agree on that."	ccednx	2019-07-13 13:20:44
22	1563017416.0	This is incredibly misleading. Congress cannot control if the president can deploy troops in emergency situations. This is basic constitutional law / separation of powers issue. This is why we need more lawyers in congress. People who have a fundamental understanding of the United States Constitution and don’t waste our tax dollars attempting to pass worthless bills.	ccednx	2019-07-13 13:30:16
23	1563028222.0	Congress is the branch that has the power to declare war. Glad the House at least finally grew a pair and are trying to take their declared powers back.

33	1562994089.0	Even if Senate votes in favor of it, Trump can veto it no issue. Plus, the Supreme Court is pocketed, so they'll overrule it if Congress tries to challenge the veto with a supermajority vote. So unfortunately, this means very little. However, Trump still cares about getting elected in 2020, so the best we can do is continue speaking out against any strike on Iran and make sure he knows that doing it will cost him the election.	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:01:29

46	1562989243.0	"It's almost like that's what the Constitution explicitly says is supposed to happen. One man deciding to go to war, fund war, or ""strike"" against foes is very clearly antithetical to what the founders intended, and it's a disgrace how Congress has ceded its power to the executive branch for the past 5 decades. It was wrong when Clinton and Obama did it, and it's still wrong now.

47	1562994281.0	I think this is great...but... I'm not exactly confident that it'll pass the Senate AND Trump would sign on. So, nothing really changes.

The president has the authority to mobilize the military for 90 days. This permission is granted so that legislation and litigation don't potentially put the country at risk. In the event that something really bad happens, like Pearl Harbor, the president can just act instantly. After that in order to continue he must petition Congress for a formal declaration of war. To do this the president must convice all of congress that there is ""a real and credible threat to the United States"". That hasn't been done since 1941. Here's the house passing a thing that literally already exists and is just ignored completely. 

What house Democrats are afraid of is the excat same thing the founding fathers where afraid might happen one day. Which is why this check and balance exists. Yet, in order to press and official declaration of war politicians on both sides would have to openly admit that the country has been doing armed conflict wrong for 80 years illegitimizing Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, Afghanistan, and every smaller conflict in the Middle East like Syria.

All this talk about coddling dictators and yet we have one guy with the ability to start whatever wars and drop whatever bombs he wants to wherever he wants to. This is why you prosecute war criminals and why its in our damn constitution that congress has to approve war. Dropping bombs is an act of war. Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbards are about the only ones willing to say this. They voted every time not to increase trumps military. Elizabeth warren and many others have voted to increase Trumps military budget. This is beyond disturbing	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:33:46

> BREAKING.July 12, 2019.WASHINGTON - The House voted Friday to curb President Trump&#039;s ability to strike Iran militarily on Friday, adopting a bipartisan provision that would require the president to get Congress&#039;s approval before authorizing military force against Tehran.

> &quot;The administration&#039;s measured response to Iran shoot-down of our U.S. military asset in international airspace shows the president is not looking for a war with Iran,&quot; Mr. McCaul said, referring to the downing of an American drone.

> It is likely Senate negotiators will try to strip out many of the House&#039;s liberal-leaning provisions, including the Iran amendment and another measure passed by the House on Thursday that would cut off American support for Saudi Arabia&#039;s war in Yemen.

All that being said, congress has no right to dictate whether or not Trump can strike Iran. They do, however, have the right to declare war or not declare war against Iran.

Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen (drone strikes), Somalia (drone strikes), Pakistan (drone strikes)..

Trump wanted sanctions on Iran to make them and Venezuela the proverbial whipping boys; as in cut off the oil supplies of the two countries that people could care less about; effectively destroying their economies.  

Even with the sanctions and severe cut to their exports, oil prices STILL tanked... so on to the next step... disable a couple of ships and put an old bait drone out there to be shot down.

Did Democrats put an end to it when Obama or Clinton were in office? Nope.

Did Republicans push for it when Reagan or George W. was in the White House? Nope.

Let’s not act like this is JUST a Republican thing that’s happening right now. This BS has been going on for generations and very few of us have cared. 

I’m glad Trump is making people think about stuff like this, but the fact is that folks on both sides of the aisle have allowed us to get to this point. It’s why we see such expansive executive powers that should never have existed. Because people are inclined to support their guy when he’s in office, and not worry about what comes next.

In the end the Constitution states:
>""The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.""

Now there is some debate on where precisely the power in the role of Commander in Chief begins and ends.  But the best point of reference here is the aforementioned War Powers Resolution passed following a decade of presidents committing troops to Southeast Asia without congressional approval.  Most Presidents afterward have considered it unconstitutional, and so ignore it in one way or another.  Ultimately the constitution gives the president the power to command a strike should one be considered necessary without needing to ask congress for anything.  Any attempt by congress to state otherwise isn't enforceable and will just be ignored, just as the War Powers Resolution was.

""Before Trump, America was full of unicorns that ate rainbows, and shat out gold""

If Iran, for instance, launched a dirty bomb and hit Israel... do you really think they're going to wait for congress to get together?  No.  They're going to strike back.

""The amendment, attached to the annual defense policy bill, would not restrict the president’s ability to respond to an attack.""

So... what... do people think Trump's going to just randomly attack them?  Even if he did, he could say it's a response to an attack... considering Iran already attacked multiple countries in the last  few weeks.

This is pointless political crap.

You can downvote all you want... but the President has always had command of the military.  The Legislature has power of the purse.  And, despite what the guy above me thinks... this doesn't force trump to go to congress to make military action.  

For instance, last time Trump was about to hit Iran... even WITH this bill... he wouldn't have needed to go to congress, because it was a response to an attack.

This is just congressmen voting on a pointless political bill, so they can say they voted to limit executive power... without limiting it one bit.

The President has two jobs: Chief Politician and the 'public face' of America, and the Commander In Chief in the event diplomacy doesn't work out. These are his core responsibilities.

Congress has power of the purse, and also has, as a check to the President's powers, the right to declare war. 

However, the President can, and always has been able, to unilaterally use the military without any input whatsoever from Congress... for as long as the money holds out. Congress can defund and can refuse to declare war, but that won't stop an immediate strike from happening. 

This is basically saying 'we won't fund any attacks on Iran'. Which won't make a hill of beans if Trump decides to go and attack Iran. It'll be over so fast that they won't have time to spend all the money already in the budget. No declaration of war needed, no budgetary acquisitions needed. Just like what happened with Iraq, the main event will be over in a matter of days.

Since he's barely able to construct a coherent sentence, yes it IS a problem.

Does anyone have any real world examples where this provision has actually had a positive outcome? I can't think of any offhand but I'm sure there has been at least one instance, more than likely whatever spurred the change initially."	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:17:16

Clinton and Obama used it to conduct air strikes on 7 different countries that didn’t result in longer military involvement thus no congressional approval, but the problem now is conducting an air strike on Iran would likely result in a much longer and more costly conflict.	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:59:45

1171	1562997179.0	"OOoh, some people really didn't like this statement.

As someone who trades oil, both long and short depending on what I see happening in the market, I can tell you I was watching the market very closely when that ship attack happened.  Oil prices were in free fall.  In fact, the day before those tankers were attacked, Oil tanked 4-5% due to yet another huge build in US inventories without any mechanism to stop the oil prices from free falling to some of the lowest prices in years.  The very next night, not even a full day went by, and those tankers were suddenly attacked without any provocation.

It doesn't matter who had a hand in it either.  Iran.  Saudi Arabia.  The US.  Russia.  All oil producing nations and corporations directly benefited as a result of these attacks which led to a near instant turn around in oil prices... with no change in supply and demand.  After oil prices fell due to reports of the glut of oil, the day of the attack, oil prices recovered everything they lost the previous day.

Since that attack, oil prices have increased 20% in a single month to a price level closer to what OPEC thinks is best for the oil industry and what they feel the overall economy can handle.  In fact, they want oil prices around the $70 mark.  That couldn't happen based on inventories alone with the major glut we're experiencing, even with Iran and Venezuela exports completely cut off.  Last month oil was at $52 a barrel.  Today WTI oil is at $60 a barrel.

If Iranian and Venezuelan oil was on the market, and this oil conflict never happened, oil would have absolutely tanked into the mid to low 40s.  Who here thinks the big players with their billions of dollars in oil sales at stake were going to simply allow that to happen?"	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:52:59

Congress is now trying to reign that in and say “we’ve had time to react and do not believe we should,” which is an appropriate reaction given how Trump has tried to circumvent congressional powers already (see executive order regarding the border wall). In general, it’s good that the president has this power.

The War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973 in response to Nixon's actions in Cambodia/Vietnam.

[The statute says](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-87/pdf/STATUTE-87-Pg555.pdf):

> ### Congressional Action
>
> Sec. 5.(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.

This applies to hostilities in Iran. Congress claims the right to force the president to remove forces from Iran, requiring only a concurrent resolution (passed by both houses, but not requiring the president's signature).

> ### Congressional Priority Procedures for Joint Resolution
> 
> Sec. 7.(c) Such a concurrent resolution passed by one House shall be referred to the committee of the other House named in subsection (a) and shall be reported out by such committee together with its recommendations within fifteen calendar days and shall thereupon become the pending business of such House and shall be voted upon within three calendar days, unless such House shall otherwise determine by yeas and nays.

So unless it’s something he knows will pass he won’t bring it up unless it’s politically expedient. See Green New Deal. He put it to a vote because he knew that not a single Republican would vote for it and it would cause strife within the Democratic Party. Centrist Dem Senators don’t support and even if they do couldn’t vote for it if they’re from a swing state. Then voting against it would have put them in direct conflict with AOC and the liberal wing of the party.

1338	1563007564.0	"He can't *just* block bills. He has no authority to single-handedly ""block"" bills. Whenever a bill fails to pass the senate, reddit comments cry ""Mitch McConnell,"" which is exactly what McConnell wants them to do.

This isn't a magic trick. When ""Mitch McConnell"" blocks a bill, what is actually happening is that Republicans are deciding to unanimously oppose the bill. And because Republicans have a majority of the senate, if they agree to oppose a bill, then it can't pass the senate.

That's the ELI5 version.

As for ""why"": the Senate Majority Leader is not a constitutional position. Mitch McConnell is not being granted special powers. He is a spokesman for the Republicans. Since the purpose of a political party is to for everyone in the party to support each other, both Democrats and Republicans can just have one person each to speak for them. It saves a lot of time and effort. Because in many cases, almost all the Republicans will vote the same way, and almost all the Democrats will vote the same way. That's what the Majority and Minority Leaders do. They just speak for their party.

When ""Mitch McConnell"" decides to ""block"" a bill, all he's saying is that the Republicans have already decided to vote against it. We already know it won't pass. There's no point wasting time pretending it will and voting on it.

So what would have happened if ""Mitch McConnell"" hadn't ""blocked"" those bills? Nothing. The bills would have gone to the Senate, and the Republicans would have voted against them, and they don't pass. Mitch McConnell is the Senate Majority Leader because his party stands behind him and supports him.

If this is actually a bipartisan bill, and the Republican senators aren't unanimously against it, then it will go to vote, and we'll see if it passes. 

And whenever people scream ""Mitch McConnell"", they are directing the negative attention all towards one person. Which is great for Republicans. It's why they keep trying to focus the media attention like this. The love talking about how ""McConnell is blocking all the bills."" If they make a decision that the public hates, everyone blames McConnell instead of their respective representatives. Mitch McConnell only has one seat in the Senate. If they can pass whatever laws they want, and they only power they give up is Mitch McConnell's seat? Then that's a fantastic trade for them. Totally worth it. And that's the worst case scenario. They might not even lose the seat if their fan base shows up to vote.

What people keep forgetting is that we shouldn't just be mad at McConnell. We should be mad at *our respective Republican senators*. For sitting around and being spineless while their party continues warmongering. If they want to stop that, if they want to stop Trump, there isn't anything McConnell can do to stop it."	ccednx	2019-07-13 10:46:04

The Republicans could at any time replace McConnell as majority leader, but they won't. Partly because they don't want to, he gets to do all the negative stuff and shoulder all of the negative press and he's safe because Kentucky is Kentucky, and partly because McConnell wields a lot of political power with the GOP and can direct where funding and campaigning will go.

>
> Sec. 5.(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.

This applies to hostilities in Iran. Congress claims the right to force the president to remove forces from Iran, requiring only a concurrent resolution (passed by both houses, but not requiring the president's signature).

> ### Congressional Priority Procedures for Joint Resolution
> 
> Sec. 7.(c) Such a concurrent resolution passed by one House shall be referred to the committee of the other House named in subsection (a) and shall be reported out by such committee together with its recommendations within fifteen calendar days and shall thereupon become the pending business of such House and shall be voted upon within three calendar days, unless such House shall otherwise determine by yeas and nays.

But now, information moves faster and our weapons move faster.  If the president wants a war, a lot can happen in 90 days, too much.

1466	1562986913.0	Wrong. The president has not always had the sweeping authority he does now as it concerns military actions. Article II of the constitution makes the president commander-in-chief. It does not give him the power to wage war as he sees fit. The Authorization for the use of Military Force Act of 2001 gave the president far more sweeping authority to conduct military operation than he had ever had historically. It is the doctrine under which Bush attacked Iraq without declaring war, Obama waged his drone wars, and Trump was set to attack Iran. The act gives the president authority to wage war without congressional authorization only when it is required to stop an actual or imminent threat to the US. Many would argue that imminent threats have not actually been present since 9/11, it is a matter of some debate. So, as you see, the power to wage war by the president's hand alone has only recently been granted and it is a far cry from such powers as they have been wielded historically.	ccednx	2019-07-13 05:01:53

1533	1562999214.0	An important thing to remember is that most of the blame for this is on congress. They basically threw away their power over war to the executive. Both parties then proceeded to further abuse those powers and congress never cares in the slightest. It really does go against the spirit of the constitution in my opinion though. In my opinion the executive’s function is to implement the “orders” (bills, declarations of war, laws, etc.) not make their own laws or declarations. The president is supposed to be a central figure that can lead the country in a war, but not a single person who can declare war on whomever they want. They’re supposed to be the metaphorical darth Vader, the guy who gets shit done, but the legislature is the emperor in the background making the real decisions (I understand people will disagree, this is just my opinion of it not saying it’s fact.)	ccednx	2019-07-13 08:26:54

Quite literally the opposite. It was drafted to try and truncate the executive branch's unchecked power over the military.

The RQ-4 was produced since 1998.  Keep in mind, that drone price you're quoting includes development cost.  To build a brand new replacement drone does not cost $150 million (or the $110 million I've seen quoted elsewhere)  Oh, and btw, our military budget is over $600 billion per year last I checked.  I'm sure Northrop Grumman isn't crying over the loss of the drone that the US government will pay to replace.

What I can confirm is $8 per barrel in oil, multiplied by the 12.3 million barrels per day that the US produced last week, equates to $98 million per day.  The world produces about 80 million barrels per day.  Times $8 per barrel.  That's $640 million of extra revenue per day.  Worth the loss of a $100 million drone?

With the US taking over as the #1 largest producer of oil in the world, and with our exports increasing by 100% since last year (when Trump was actually attempting to keep oil prices low), it's now in the US' best interest for oil prices to not topple.

What happens when oil prices tank?  Our shale companies go out of business.  That means other countries will grab up the market share.

Saudi Arabia may have made a deal with Trump to keep up their supply... but that doesn't mean they want oil prices to topple to an unprofitable level.  Therefore, the solution is to stop other nations from saturating the market.  Suddenly Trump puts sanctions on Iran and Venezuela to stop them from delivering their oil.

Ironically, you should checkout Canadian oil imports to the US as well.  They've more than made up for the huge amount of oil Venezuela is no longer sending the US.  Canada is sending the US record amounts of oil, well surpassing what they did in previous years.

I believe that this was an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for 2020. 

If the Senate does not act, or if this bill ultimately fails to get enacted into law in whatever form, the Department of Defense would be forced to shut down on October 1, 2019 and remain shut down until both the NDAA and the Defense appropriations act are made law.

Federal agencies require both the appropriation of money from the U.S. Treasury as well as the authorization to spend that money in order to operate.

The War Powers Act in 1973 clarifies this, but also gives the power to the president to temporarily mobilize forces, but only in case of imminent attack against the United States.  (Whether or not Congress can even grant power to the president that is not given in the Constitution baffles me, but that's another issue).

When Obama attached Libya, it was the first time in history when a president attacked a foreign country without consulting Congress first.  It was completely unconstitutional.  Additionally, we were not under imminent attack, thereby violating the War Powers Act.   The real reason why Libya was attacked is the perfect example of why we don't want presidents to endanger us.

1730	1563019487.0	Thank you for the explanation.  I guess what concerns me about this method is that even though there is majority consent that a given bill will not pass, they end up avoiding going on the record as voting against what the people (at least as represented by the house) want.

I'd say both sides are guilty here as shown by that for example, another possible examples might be drone strikes under Obama vs Trump. 

It's interesting how the even imgur uploader ignored what the chart clearly seems to show and tried to frame it in an anti-Republican/republican-sheep type of way, writing 
>""Republican approval of the CIA remained consistently higher than the Democrats, mostly rising and falling in tandem with them over time...UNTIL December 2016, when the intelligence community reported their conclusions regarding Russia's interference with the election.""

Not highlighting the fact that the reason the republicans suddenly showed less support was the democrat spike following the Russian anti-Trump narrative. Essentially proving my point for me, had he caught this, this image just likely wouldn't have been in the album.

Regardless, for any military unit that is under the jurisdiction of the federal government, the chain of command _always_ goes up to and stops at the president of the United States, and the president is the only member of the chain of command who is not a military officer. This isn't supposition, this is drilled into recruits in training, at least it was in my day.

To have it any other way would be crazy. If the president isn't the commander in chief when there's not an official war on, then who are the joint chiefs responsible to?

Ultimately this legislation is extremely similar in many regards to the War Powers Resolution, and we've seen the result of that.  We have years of debate from legal professionals and previous actions by presidents in regards to it.  You can read up on Campbell v. Clinton if you want a bit more on that.  It was even argued at one point there that a strike on Yugoslavia didn't count as a war in any capacity because the outcome of any military action was indisputably favored toward the United States.  You can quote how you think the constitution should be interpreted all you want, ultimately this is how it has been interpreted in the past though.  There is precedent stating that this is ultimately going to be an empty gesture and I have no reason to believe any different.

The last paragraph describes how the supreme court refuses to hear cases that Congress brings forth against the presidents when they engage militarily without congressional approval or a declared state of war.

After this, I'd look up congressional suits against the executive branch in response to Reagan and HWB's military engagements.

The extent of their air force is F-5 copies, F-14s, F-4s, supported by ""AIM-54s"", AIM-9Bs, and AIM-7s. Their SAMs are old too - KUBs for the most part. Nowhere near as effective against a modern threat, like F-22s and F-35s, even 117s. New missile effectiveness is as impossible to verify as their AIM-54 copy. Tanks are as impossible to verify. The only way they'd 'win' is if they become a big insurgency, which is likely considering the area, the ideology, and the history of the effectiveness of the insurgency, since the US would be very hesitant to commit war crimes on a large enough scale to eliminate an insurgency. 

But, also considering its history with insurgencies, I doubt the US would fall to that, since they don't need to worry about much. Considering a lot of reports from non-US sources that Iran has been attacking shipping, and it's not something new to them, I doubt the world would back such a backwater nation.

Yes.  And, Iran has proven to, consistently over the last few months attack US, and allies.  It even is right now, as we speak threatening to retaliate against the UK and USA for moving ships into international waters near Iran.  That's a real, imminent threat, as we speak.

2.) This bill does nothing to stop Trump from striking Iran, considering Iran already attacked at least 4 nations(UK, USA, Norway, Japan).  Any strike that Trump makes, would obviously be considered a response to an attack.

3.) This is just so that Politicians(Both Democrat, and Republican) can add to their reelection campaign commercials  the idea that ""I voted to stop the wars in the Middle East""!

1928	1563004699.0	"The rate may be higher but total killed to knowledge has not been surpassed. Obama also counted all of age males killed as combatants. 4 us citizens are more than one. Obama expanded the scope of the war on terror. Libya is a complete and total disaster and was a war of aggression. Obama with the Cia directly aided rebels under Al queda leadership in Syria. Obama started the cooperation with saudi Arabia in Yemen. He also failed to prosecute the Bush administration for war torture which is itself a war crime under the international treaty on torture and then threatened Spain and Germany from doing so which they are also obligated to do under the treaty. He reneged on his promise to release Abu gharab torture photos. His failure to correct the massive war criminal overstep of the Bush administration enshrined it into our legacy and will allow for it to happen again and it legitimized an illegal war of aggression for which Bush and his compatriots should be rotting in a jail cell for the rest of thier lives. Bush is already being whitewashed by the media and praised. Obama greatly increased drone strikes night raids and assassinations in Afghanistan and began a policy of double tapping drone strikes killing rescuers on scene which is a war crime. He destroyed a hospital run by doctors without borders in 2015. The night raids led to well over 15000 afghans held in detention on little to no evidence. It can not be overstated that Obama made the case for murdering us citizens abroad which will allow future presidents to do the same. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/world/asia/drone-strikes-reveal-uncomfortable-truth-us-is-often-unsure-about-who-will-die.html
The process of deciding who dies was based on very little and sketchy information. He greatly expanded nsa survellance under the guise of fighting the war on terror but the fact was all Americans were being spied on. Torture and renditions continued under the first term. One of the rendition sites was called Godka in Somalia.
That's just off the top of my head. I'm sure I'm forgetting quite a lot and there's I'm sure an overwhelming amount I don't know.
Trump is terrible and in time he may prove worse but he's going to have to do a hell of a lot to catch up.
From the outside it looks like trump is less warlike until the Neocons get their way. Glad he didn't allow that strike against Iran. But Bolton should be in prison and it's Obamas fault he isn't there. The Neocons have been pushing for war with Iran since Bush. They all should have been banished from political life but obama chose to look forward not back and so they are still considered acceptable in ""polite"" company"	ccednx	2019-07-13 09:58:19

As for calling off the strike, I just explained Trump’s own bad decisions and antagonism put us in that situation. By your logic, if I don’t attack someone, then I saved their life. This situation could have been avoided if Trump had thought about the consequences of his actions and had a more levelheaded foreign policy.

The stock market is at an all time high thanks in part to high confidence due to a roaring economy. Highest employment numbers in decades for both black and latino citizens, highest female employment. Isis has been crippled and has lost all territory, the lives saved by this alone is enough to rank him highly. Addressing inflated prescription drug prices, the boosting of funding to the military and border patrol, selling rice to China, increasing the country's status as an energy exporter. Mandating that for every new regulation two must be removed, removing the US from the TPP, removing the US from the Paris climate accord, approving Keystone and Dakota pipelines, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital (something others had said they would do, but didn't), and other things that escape me. 
There are things going on in the country that the forefathers didn't want, that's true. In order to realign the country with their wishes, a cultural shift back to the system of values that were once the norm is necessary. That is what Trump wants. 
The forefathers certainly did not want illegal aliens pouring across the border every day. 
There is corruption and exploitation in every industry, because some humans will inevitably do bad things to other people. It's the job of citizens to weed out these problems and arrive at sensible, logical conclusions. The Catholic church has been exposed with some of the most horrific acts imaginable, yet we aren't calling for every church to be shut down. We have to remove the bad people from the detention facilities and fund them adequately that people are fed, clothed and sheltered humanely. 
Children are separated from adults by law in any detainment. There have been many cases of children arriving at the border with adults of no relation, posing as family but the children were taken and made to lie under duress. The separation rules in part are to address this. 
One question I would like to know is why so many are entering the country illegally and then trying to apply for asylum. It is perfectly legal to apply for asylum at a port of entry, so I wonder why are so many deliberately breaking the law knowing what the result will be. While I acknowledge bad things have happened, until a better alternative is suggested to house, feed, clothe and process the claims of the tens of thousands of illegal aliens coming over the border, I am left thinking the detainment centres are necessary. I have yet to hear of **any** alternative suggestion besides 'shutting them down', which would result in no feeding clothing or sheltering of the illegal aliens, effectively rendering the adults and children homeless and without a means to survive.

For me, the me comes from clearly biased and subjective journalism aimed to remake a generation that believes and acts like we are literally reliving the civil rights era (they got a few votes back then!).

It is a constant battle because they are all EXTREMELY biased and aim to set the country backward for votes.

It seems like every news story has an aim to divide people and blame the presiddnt for the many woes Of The nation instead of anything with actual substance.

But it goes much deeper than that, it's 100% pure tribalism: they're not even about the ""Republican"" party, the militants are even calling for the murder of Republicans who don't toe the latest Trump line, they're completely about the tribe they pledged allegiance to, it's not even a matter of party or ideology, it's the tribe.

That's how they end up supporting measures that directly hurt them (many Trumpists lost healthcare coverage under his administration, directly affecting their quality of life and life expectancy), because the tribe sits at the top, their own well-being is completely secondary.

That's how they can call for the executions of anyone, police forces and republicans alike, who dare going against the will of the tribe - or how they can see Putin's Russia as a much closer ally to their tribe, than their own fellow countrymen or fellow party members.

It is then not surprising that such tribalism:

* **festers and celebrates violence over negotiation and compromises**: the tribe members are always violent and belligerent to show their value in the tribe, their dedication to it, **only the leader** has the right to negotiate and change his stance (even multiple times in the same sentence or day, like Trump have been doing regularly). Then the tribe members will immediately turn violent and hostile with whoever doesn't follow the latest stance of the leader, because that's the only way they can have any value in the tribe: this is what Trump calls ""loyalty"" - a completely blind devotion to the tribe, regardless of what it means - it could mean jumping off a cliff or cutting off your own hand, this is the way someone show their ""loyalty"" to the tribe.
* recruits among the **most disenfranchised and alienated people**, the people the most excluded from the prior political process, who feel completely ignored and abandoned by the existing system of political representivity. These people will be the most ""loyal"" to whoever finally acknowledge their existence and existential and daily suffering, they feel like they have everything to win (politically and socially) in giving up their entire existence to the tribe. Going to war with Iran for electoral reasons? Sabotaging their own healthcare coverage? Spending all the public money on a symbolic but completely useless wall? Being in complete denial about global warning and environmental issues, letting all other countries get a head start on all these majors worldwide issues? Doesn't matter, if the tribe leader said so, we will follow him to hell if that's what he said we should be doing.

&#x200B;

The only way to stop the rampant tribalism going on in the US is to recover all these people, by respectfully acknowledging their existence and their suffering, and share the wealth to give them hope, a purpose in life, an individual existence. If all these people had projects in life, they wouldn't pray every night that they would get a chance at shooting some Iranians or Mexicans to ""defend"" their tribe.

This is what the Democratic party have completely failed to do, preferring to mock and ridicule these people because they were 'foolishly' associating themselves with the worst (neo-nazis and such) without realizing what it meant. Not realizing that these people were only that because they were completely abandoned by everyone else.

If the people know they were born poor and will die poor, and their children will follow the same path, and their grandchildren too - that they have absolutely not a shred of hope of escaping their current social condition - *then* they will seek hope and inspiration from the tribe and its leader, who promise them a fabulous and powerful nation, the strongest and most heroic superpower, defeating all their enemies in brutal wars including regular war crimes, and internal hunts and lynching by para-military militia.

The exact same happens in Russia, whenever the TV channels sell the latest war started by Putin to sell that ""dream"" to the population - the same happens all over the Middle-East and Africa, where tribe leaders sell such ""dream"" to the populations, because the reality is completely hopeless: a durable widespread stagnation, firmly anchored in nation-wide corruption."	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:42:27

If you accept this view it will radically alter your view of politics and what people believe and how they argue. It will also make you confront your own beliefs that you rationalize.

We never see the outside world but only the maps we draw inside our skulls. Perception is a gamble. There is too much data to process and we have to make cartoons to Make sense of what we see. That sense making operates on a mammalian nervous system that comes with built in filtering mechanisms. A big one is the disgust response. How active and how intense your disgust response will make you react quite differently from someone who's disgust response is rarely triggered. That's just one factor that can seperate you from someone else as though you are living in a completely different universe.

That said I think there is an argument to be made that he's a particular risk with that power.

Why do we need to wait until he's already done it once to take these precautions?  Trump himself already said he ordered a strike on Iran then called it off on a whim.

On the other hand, there's also an argument that the previous two Presidents were very quick to military action and shouldn't have this power either. (And Hillary Clinton as well.) I don't disagree with this---I don't think any of them should have this power.

Finally, John Bolton is in the white House. The fact that he's there calls Trump's pacifism into question immediately.  And I want him to have literally zero say in our military action.

Nice red herring but ok i especially love when people argue against their own position lmao

This is because there is a hard time limit on these sorts of actions. I think it was something like 90 days--after that, Congress would need to vote on whether or not the action can continue.

Could you clarify that sentence for me? The law exists because it has never been used? The 3rd amendment has never been used, but that's not the reason why it exists, it exists because the British often commandeered private homes regularly rather than build permanent (or even temporary) barracks. The War Powers Act, just as the Congressional contempary authorization in the 1790s for the Barbary War, has a purpose and it has been used a dozen times since it was initially passed in the 1940s. It may contradict the function of declaration of wars, but it is still a law that Congress passed and Truman signed into law. Had Trump not veto'd the restrictions regarding the Yemen conflict that Saudis are outmatching the Yemeni Shia in the Sanders-Lee bill, then it would have been a crime had Trump continued to support Saudia Arabia's war. You know how I know that? Because that's what got Reagan in trouble with the Iran-Contra scandal.

Over the course of Obama’s time in office, his military dropped 34 bombs per day, 12,500 per year. And in Trump’s first year in office, he averaged 121 bombs dropped per day, for an annual total of 44,096.

Venezuela oil exports to the US last year averaged over 500 kbpd.  Even that was low, they used to send us closer to 800 kbpd in 2016/2017.

https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/

See Report #8, Click on Data 1, and scroll all the way down.

Here's Iran's oil production since Trump re-imposed sanctions... Against the will of all other countries who were part of the Iranian nuclear deal BTW.  (Keep in mind, this graph is only through March... Iranian oil production has tanked further since then)

https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10D48/production/_106763986_iran_oil_production_apr_2019_976-nc.png

Lastly, the US (under Obama) began allowing oil exports; which were previously banned.  Since last year, oil exports have nearly doubled.  The more we export, the larger the draw on our inventory, the more prices go up.

Even with all of the above.... we still had an oil glut that was leading to oil prices toppling.  Oil prices can only go so far before the US shale companies start falling into bankruptcy, forfeiting oil market share to foreign nations.

Hence suddenly two ships exploded, a drone was shot down, an impending war with Iran started, Iranian oil ships started being captured...etc...  Even then, oil prices are still being weighed down by oversupply and weak demand.  

Oil prices have gone up to a more sustainable level, and US shale producers and US customers are directly benefiting from it.  Shale is holding oil prices down for US customers, but you don't want those prices getting too low or it'll wipe out the shale industry, potentially causing a huge surge in oil prices.

If I'm not mistaken, that provision is a temporary emergency power, meant for such cases as ""oh shit, we've been invaded and Congress can't meet to declare war, just let the President hit back while we move our government"".

The problem is, very little as formerly intended is actually being followed anymore. At some point after WW2, Congress started throwing up their hands and going ""Eh, whatever the President wants to do. So how about we take an entire month off for Easter?"""	ccednx	2019-07-13 18:33:38

Congress has required deployments and maintaining of troops but I doubt the WPA would stand to a challenge in today's court. Congress has precedent to prevent the removal of troops but I don't believe there is precedent to limit the President's authority to deploy troops.

I don't believe there is any judicial precedent to support this move or the WPA overall. I believe this is a grave mistep by Congress here.

It was Hillary Clinton who said that Russian cyberattacks should be treated as an act of war.

I think those both need to be changed.  If a bill or motion has sufficient interest it should be required to hold a vote on it within a certain period of time, even if the majority leader doesn't want to.

2466	1563023785.0	"Okay, quick and dirty lesson on how the US government works:

So the federal legislative body is called Congress, and is divided into an upper house and lower house: the latter is called the House of Representatives, consisting of representatives from all 50 states with the number per state depending on population; the former is Senate, and each state elects two senators.

Our politics are dominated by two parties, Democratic and Republican. At the end of every election cycle, the House votes to choose the Speaker of the House, who is in charge of the House (moderates discussion, calls for votes, etc). The Senate is slightly different, electing two people: the party with a majority in Senate picks the Senate Majority Leader, who functions like the Speaker of the House; the other party picks the Senate Minority Leader, who is *supposed* to work in tandem with the Majority Leader. Spoiler: that isn't ever the case.

The Majority Leader decides what is on the agenda, allocates speaking time and moderates discussion, convenes and adjourns/recesses Senate, and when to close discussion and call for a vote. If they are opposed to a bill, they can decide to kill it by refusing to allow a vote to take place.

Our boy Mitch McConnell *loves* to abuse his powers to ignore the will of the people. [Like that time he refused to vote on Obama's SCOTUS nominee for fourteen months](https://www.npr.org/2016/03/16/470664561/mcconnell-blocking-supreme-court-nomination-about-a-principle-not-a-person), leaving the court that literally decides what our laws mean short one person.

Obama did not attack Libya to stop IS.  The public talking point was to protect the citizens of Libya, when the real intent was regime change.  This was confirmed after the fact.

Clinton in 1999 was different.  As I recall, he told Congress, they said no, and then he did it anyway.   Obama didn't ask permission beforehand.  He forced us into war and killed our soldiers for his own personal policy decision... Not for our safety.

 And, yes, the president is limited.  He can't legally attack whomever he wants. Note section (c)(3):

(c)""The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.""

None of these were national emergencies.  The presidents have acted illegally in terms of the War Powers Act and unconstitutionally because Congress has no authority to give power that not expressly given in the Constitution.

However, none of this really matters, because presidents can do whatever illegal acts they want unless they are impeached and removed from power.  Trail of Tears with Andrew Jackson comes to mind.

Just to clarify, the formal declarations of war typically count any legislation that has the phrase ""declaration of war"" in the title, while authorized military engagements don't include that phrase (e.g. the War on Terror legislation was titled ""Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists"", Persian Gulf War was titled ""Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991"", and the Iraq war was titled ""Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002"", while the various declarations for WWII were titled ""Declaration of state of war with ____"", with separate declarations for Japan, Italy, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania.)"	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:50:40

Everybody forgets that, during the 2016 election, Russia hacked the GOP/RNC at the exact same time they hacked the DNC. 

We all know the material stolen from the DNC got leaked but nothing ever came out of the GOP hack.

Now, the fact that there was no GOP/RNC leaks means one of two things:

1) the Russians got absolutely nothing because Republicans are squeaky clean (LOL!!! at the very least there would've been some damning insider correspondence during the GOP's 'Never Trump' phase of the election)

2) Russia is using whatever they got from the hack as blackmail; probably threatening to release it during an election cycle

Now, I'm not trying to get all tinfoil about this, but, I do suspect that the fact that the GOP is now soft on Russia, lifting sanctions, Rand Paul is hand delivering letters to Putin, Mitch Mcconnell blocked Obama from announcing and reacting to the 2016 election interference, the states of which Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell preside over are now seeing unprecedented multi-million dollar investments from the companies of Russian oligarchs, etc etc etc.....

>  A near-universal assumption of the founding generation was the danger posed by a standing military force. Far from being composed of honorable citizens dutifully serving the interests of the nation, armies were held to be “nurseries of vice,” “dangerous,” and “the grand engine of despotism.” Samuel Adams wrote in 1776, such a professional army was, “always dangerous to the Liberties of the People.” Soldiers were likely to consider themselves separate from the populace, to become more attached to their officers than their government, and to be conditioned to obey commands unthinkingly. The power of a standing army, Adams counseled, “should be watched with a jealous Eye.”

.

>  The immense costs necessary to raise and maintain a standing army (moneys required for pay, uniforms, rations, weapons, pensions, and so forth) would burden the populace with an immense and crippling tax burden that would require the government to confiscate more and more of the citizenry’s wealth in order to meet those massive expenses.

2634	1563051433.0	"> Finally, John Bolton is in the white House. The fact that he's there calls Trump's pacifism into question immediately. And I want him to have literally zero say in our military action.

In fairness, Trump has spoken about why he has Bolton there. He has said that if he listened to Bolton we'd be attacking everyone, but he keeps him on for the difference in perspective, and listens to his other advisers as well before making his decision.

The thing is though, that the legislation wouldn't stop anything, regardless of whether you agree with Trump's stance of having multiple perspectives on issues. You can't leash a president's ability to respond to military threats behind weeks of Congressional bickering. It would make it effectively impossible to do anything, which would be taken advantage of by other countries extremely quickly.

It's definitely not an easy question. We don't want to give the president too much military power, but he has to have it to a degree. It makes our choice in who we put in the office of supreme importance, and I do agree that Trump was a shot in the dark. He has at times said he'd turn the middle east into a glass floor while simultaneously saying he wants to negotiate peace in the middle east. Just like he threatened fire and fury against North Korea and then became the first president to meet them diplomatically on their own soil.

I think it's kind of a diplomatic power game. You convince dangerous nations that you're a true threat to them, and then take their fear of you and turn it into an opportunity to cool your relations. Dangerous moves, that somewhat rely on foreign leaders being sound of mind, but so far it's working."	ccednx	2019-07-13 22:57:13

2.) The LAW does nothing to stop Trump from Striking Iran without congress's approval.

Do you understand? It says right in the bill(and law, if it becomes a law), that this does not effect the president's ability to respond to attack... and ANY response Trump makes will be in response to Iran's attacks... that they've already made.

It doesn't say ""Iran attacking US drones, or UK ships, or Norwegian Ships, or Japanese ships don't qualify as attacks"".  If it had that in there, then the Law/Bill would have some meaning/effect.

But, as it's written, it literally does nothing.

If it becomes a law tomorrow, Trump can the next day strike Iran without congress's approval, for attacking a UK ship.  Or, he could do it in response to Iran shooting down a US drone.  Or, in response to Iran attacking a Japanese ship.  Or in response to Iran attacking a Norwegian ship. 

The UK, Germany, and USA are all in agreement... Iran attacked US allies(Japan, Norway).   So, ANY response by Trump would be considered a response to an attack... and thus wouldn't require congressional approval.

If this bill becomes a law... Trump can strike Iran any time he wants, without approval.

You'll also note the article supports what I said about Trump lying. Trump lied when he said we gave them 150 billion dollars.  Besides the 150 billion number probably being way too big, it also makes clear that money was Iranian assets, just frozen in banks around the world due to sanctions.

""Trump’s use of the $150 billion continues to be problematic. That was a high-end estimate, and the actual number available to Iran appears to have been between $25 billion and $50 billion.""

This article shows exactly what he wants for oil prices. The fact of the matter is that the oil is still in the ground in the US, it doesn’t matter which E&P company produces it. If one company dies then the bank owns the assets and sells them to a different E&P company. You won’t wipe out the shale industry! What happened 4 years ago when OPEC tried to do that exact thing? They ended up making shale companies more efficient and able to profit at a lower price and hurt their own economies badly. 

Shale is very quick to ramp up and down. Again I’m in the industry and know all about it. It literally takes 3 months for one rig to drill a 4 well pad, frac it and get it producing oil. That huge surge in prices would be very short lived followed by years of a glut like we’ve been in. 

The sanctions on Venezuela did jack shit to their production. Years of socialism and not paying to maintain their wells killed their production. The sanctions were because of what they were doing to their people. Again, NOTHING TO DO WITH OIL PRICES. Iran sanctions were put on because they violated the terms of the Iran deal. That 1.3 million bbls/day that’s come off the market since their peak production is nothing at this point in the global picture.

If any action within the bounds of the system could affect change, they require vigorous and open-minded public discourse, which is also - you guessed it - fundamentally broken.

Meanwhile Republicans (particularly their politicians, evangelicals and overall Trump supporters) at current are the mirror opposite of the screaming overly sensitive ""safe-space"" liberal snowflake white knights they despise so much that even many rational democrats can't stand because democrats aren't about rabid intolerance, and neither were the Republicans a little over 10 years ago.  Republicans are so far to the right they're laying down on the ground and kissing the diarrhea they spewed as though it were sacred ground.

The Republican party has fallen and become a parody of its former self.  The Democrats, frustratingly passive and uncompetitive they might be, are the only rational party currently standing, but are unfortunately supported by some irrational, intolerant, and very loud extremists of their own that hog the spotlight and hijack the message whenever and where ever they show up.

To be clear, there are plenty of voters closer to the center, but being close to the center, like simply understanding locking kids in cages is wrong, maintaining business holdings or blocking investigations into your own crimes is clear corruption, and being a racist should not be tolerated, regardless of whether or not you're a liberal or conservative, makes One appear democrat right now.

The bill passed the house and is awaiting a vote in the senate but the senate isn't planning to vote on it. They'll bring up that bill with an amendment to ""strike all language after H.R. 268"" and insert the following (senate version of appropriations bill). They then vote on that and pass it back to the house. If the house passes that exact language then it goes to the president. If the house amends it then it goes back to the senate. If the two sides can't agree then a conference committee is formed of Republicans and Democrats from the house and senate that get together to create an agreed upon final version of the bill.

Basically how things are set up is that Congress has the power to raise an army and declare war while the president has the power to direct the military that congress raises. But we have a standing military therefore the president always has a military to direct. 

In the past, the president has (for the most part) gone to congress first to get their permission to use the military. But there have also been some instances where they acted first because there wasn’t time to go to congress. After Vietnam congress realized this system wasn’t working as the president didn’t actually need congress’s permission to use the military, only to declare war. So they enacted legislation that requires their permission after 60 days. But the president still has the power to, at least initially, use military power. They just need permission to **keep** using that power. 

So here what the House is saying is that they’ve determined there is no need for use of the military at this time so the President will be blocked from using it. They have a provision in case we are attacked, which is appropriate, but they’re keeping the president’s powers of the military in check saying we don’t need to act at this time."	ccednx	2019-07-13 09:27:53

In 1973 Congress scaled back this power with the War Powers Resolution (far more sweeping then this amendment which you claim is unconstitutional) and granted more authority in 2001 with the Authorization for Use of Military Force.

Name calling happens regardless of political ideology because personal maturity isn’t necessarily correlated to a political stance. Mis-identification of self with held beliefs is incredibly widespread, and tends to result in the degradation, if not the full breakdown, of rational discourse.

That being said, caging children who have come to our border seeking aid could be considered objectively evil. (And by the way, as this has been happening since long before Trump I consider it a bipartisan issue, exemplifying either the apathy or the cruelty of the aristocratic class more so than that of any political ideology.) However, the reaction of the public is of interest, perhaps telling, as what is commonly referred to as the left sees a moral issue with the current border practice while the right seems to view it as a system finally operating as it should.

2869	1563006573.0	"You are missing the point of a nuclear war. There isn’t supposed to be a winner, and the only time you launch is when they launch. It only takes one person for a reason, if a Russian sub is 50 miles of the coast of DC (which I’m sure there always is ) you have about 3 minutes to guarantee MAD.  The whole safety of nuclear warfare lies in the complete destruction of the warring parties, and shortly thereafter the rest of the world, and lack of desire to do so.   Therefore it is in everyone’s best interest to ensure the button can be pressed as quickly as possible. 

As far as “just one person”, if the president called for release it’s not just all missiles go! The Joint chiefs are involved and “strike packages” are presented. And many parts have to move.  The US has a “Two-Man” rule that all operations regarding nuclear weapons need to be confirmed by a second person.  For release the President and SecDef must agree, but only the President could order the strike. 

Let’s say the president decides to launch a strike for some reason, if the SecDef decides its a bad idea he can just not confirm it.  Also the generals can just not issue the orders.  The cabinet would have time to enact the 25th amendment.  Although it sounds dire that only one person can order a nuclear strike there is a lot that must happen for that to become reality."	ccednx	2019-07-13 10:29:33

2882	1563078878.0	I've been thinking about this a lot. Most Republican policies are implemented locally or statewide. This means the people hurt most by Republican education, health, and other social policies are actually their republican base supporters, who are more than happy to have their rights slowly eroded in the name of God and small government. So when mainstream media freaks out about Republicans being power control freaks and that being the cause of their policies, it sounds so naive. It's such bad reasoning. It seems to me that the reason Republicans remove education and abortion rights isn't just to flex their power, which is what mainstream media keeps saying for some reason. They simply want their supporters to be dumb and gullible and have more kids so 18 years later they'll have more dumb and gullible kids who were raised in the same low education environment. If I were a Republican and I knew that my ideas were supported by an ever dwindling base, I would think of ways to prevent that too. Obviously they cannot do this with real policy changes, so they desperately cling on to their supporters and try to come up with any way they can to increase them. Obviously I have no proof that this is why Republicans are so keen on removing abortion and sex education from places like Alabama and missouri, but I dont doubt this is a big part of their plan.	ccednx	2019-07-14 06:34:38

2891	1563007295.0	The reason people think that way, especially older folks, is because to them socialism and communism is interchangeable/the same thing. You gotta remember that the enemy was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Not the Union of Communist republics. The word socialism is a dirty word because it brings back imagines of a time that's gone. Another reason why people are so against it is because they have the idea that socialism leads to communism, which I myself really doubt. I think alot of Socialist policy's would be great for this country and set us back on course to being the world's only superpower again. Things like universal health care and forgiving college debt are at the top of the list for me personally. But at the same time I can't see anyone voting for someone who labels themselves a Socialist, you see what I mean? I think we need a new term, even if it's the exact same thing.

Why not keep your current system intact and have a welfare system as a safety net for people? Those policies work great in Europe, especially in the Scandinavian and northwestern EU states. It's the current system that has brought the US prosperity, at least as a nation. Ironing out the class-based inequalities is what should be worked on.

Iran controls the straights of Hormuz, the entrance to the Arabian gulf. I still remember the f-18s sitting at tension when I went through there, it was the only time I felt vulnerable on an aircraft carrier. That would not be easy for us to take even with our Navy.

They probably didn't want war when the nuclear deal was new, but now that it's been trampled on, they just might want a war. We were wrong to pull out of the deal. Trump is an idiot.

Eh, just assumed that's who you meant by the tone of your comment and the sarcastic quote ""Before Trump, America was full of unicorns that ate rainbows, and shat out gold"". As an outsider, the only party in the US that at least tries to critically adress US history and the role of government are the Democrats. 

>Yes. I understand this. This bill has nothing to do with declaring war. It's about asking congress for approval for an airstrike. 

Don't you think it's a good first step to congress taking back the power of declaring wars, if in the past any and all reasons by a president basically unilaterally led the country into shit wars for shit reasons?

>It's still an example of the USA attacking people without declaring a war. If you think this bill was about forcing congress to declare war for military strikes... you're out of luck(and like I said earlier... misunderstanding what is in this bill).

I didn't say that. Also not misunderstanding the bill. It just seems to me like you are trying to show what a smart-ass you are against the general sentiment on reddit that Congress should declare wars and approve military action. Yeah, this is not the same thing but people are still pissed that retards like Trump and Bush can give some half-assed lies and the US mindlessly bombs the shit out of some middle eastern country and/or sends their own sons and daughters to die. Apparently this time because of two trade ships from other countries even though these other countries said the US shouldn't send Iran to the stone age because of that.

>I know you guys can do better than that.

Oh, are we two sports teams now? Who are my guys? Just checking, I'm kinda new here.

>I'm honestly confused as to why this guy is even mentioning Obama, and War declarations, when nobody has referenced them... this is about airstrikes, and Trump... not War Declarations, and Obama.

Well, the difference is simply that I can read between the lines and you just want to argue some point no one really brough up. What the OP you first replied to clearly wants is more competences for Congress. I don't think anyone would say you'd have to bother with congressional procedures if literally Pearl Harbor 2 happened, where the cause and the enemy are clear. But what people like the OP comment (I assume) are tired of are wars against concepts and wars based on lies, one of which Trump and his advisors are seemingly itching to get into."	ccednx	2019-07-13 05:20:49

&#x200B;

You're probably being downvoted because you're being obnoxious. If you were right, maybe you'd get more of a pass from people, but you've got a ton of hyperbolic statements in your own responses, the sort of comment which you're directly complaining about from your first statement.

&#x200B;

>The way it used to be, when Congress had to sign off on military action.

&#x200B;

You take issue with this statement by OP, because it's not true. And you're right, it's not completely true. It's simplistic, and doesn't take into account a number of practical issues that were made clear during the 20th century. But the version of the world you're describing, in terms of what the President has historically been allowed to do as Commander-in-Chief, is also pretty simplistic and inaccurate. So, for starters, you're being a hypocrite. And since you're not even being polite about it, you get downvotes.

&#x200B;

From you:

>1.) President has always been Commander in Chief, and can direct the armed forces as he sees fit, in response to attacks. This has existed, continuously, without interruption, from the start of the USA, to today.

&#x200B;

From wikipedia:

>According to historian [Thomas Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Woods), ""Ever since the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War), Article II, Section 2 \[...\] has been interpreted 'The president has the power to initiate hostilities without consulting Congress' \[....\] But what the framers actually meant by that clause was that once war has been declared, it was the president’s responsibility as commander-in-chief to direct the war. Alexander Hamilton spoke in such terms when he said that the president, although lacking the power to declare war, would have ""the direction of war when authorized or begun."" The president acting alone was authorized only to repel sudden attacks (hence the decision to withhold from him only the power to ""declare"" war, not to ""make"" war, which was thought to be a necessary emergency power in case of foreign attack).[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#cite_note-15)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#cite_note-16) Since [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), every major military action has been technically a U.S. military operation or a U.N. ""[police action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_action)"", which are deemed legally legitimate by Congress, and various [United Nations Resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Resolution) because of decisions such as the [Gulf of Tonkin Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_Resolution) or the [Resolution of The Congress Providing Authorization for Use of Force In Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Resolution).

&#x200B;

So you are correct that the President has always been Commander-in-Chief, since the beginning. But what that statement means has also been argued, adjusted, legislated and judicated on, since the beginning of this nation. What you're implying -- a President that is free to engage in any armed conflict once the U.S. has been attacked -- is neither assumed to be true by the Constitution, some Framers, nor numerous people both before and after the War Powers Clause was enacted.

&#x200B;

Obama was brought up because of this statement:

>""Before Trump, America was full of unicorns that ate rainbows, and shat out gold""

You didn't specify how much ""before"", so it's unclear if you're talking about Obama, Washington, or somewhere in-between. Maybe you only consider history back to World War II. Maybe OP thinks that America had a better policy about war before Roosevelt invaded Panama in 1903. Maybe it was unicorns and rainbows back then. We \*were\* on the gold standard, so at least that part was true.

&#x200B;

Was it a knee-jerk reaction to assume you were talking about Obama. Sure. Is it understandable? Yes. Did you politely correct them? No, you're looking for a fight.

>I know you guys can do better than that.

&#x200B;

The reason why war declarations are being brought up, is because the bigger argument should be about what kinds of engagements the President is allowed to do when war is declared, vs. what kind of engagements the President is allowed to do during 'police actions.' You want to have that argument too.

>I think we SHOULD curb the executive branch's ability to use the military, when it violates another nation's sovereignty. But, this bill does nothing of the sort.

That conversation should be directly tied to what 'making war' means, and what the process is for 'declaring' it. Because that's when you \*are\* allowed to violate another nation's sovereignty. Which is tightly coupled with the links everyone else is providing you. You \*could\* choose to engage in that conversation,

 But instead, you're shutting down useful conversation, yelling about how 'right' you are while providing limited constructive proactive statements, and generally trying your hardest to push buttons while hiding behind a thin veneer of civility and 'I'm just trying to have an argument' style tactics. Also knowing as 'trolling'.

Sounds to me like this bill's passage into law would make it harder for the President to initiate an unwarranted and unprovoked attack on Iran, while leaving him free to respond should Iran directly attack the United States or its military. 

Sounds reasonable. Not sure why you're so dug-in on the ""does nothing"" aspect of the thing. It is problematic that your framing presumes both that the President would not initiate an unprovoked attack on Iran - I think he would if he thought it'd go well for him. It is also problematic that your framing presupposes the eventuality of Iranian attacks. 

I think there are a lot of idiots who think a war with Iran would be a swell idea, and I think anything that makes war with Iran even a fraction less likely is a good thing.

But, this bill had nothing to do with that... at all.  It literally did nothing.  It was a fake ploy to placate people so that they DON'T have to take ANY steps toward taking back the power of declaring wars.

>Yeah, this is not the same thing but people are still pissed that retards like Trump and Bush can give some half-assed lies and the US mindlessly bombs the shit out of some middle eastern country and/or sends their own sons and daughters to die. 

I understand people are pissed about that(Bush, Trump)... and Obama's drone attacks.  I certainly am.  That's why they made the bill, to get votes... and act like they were fixing the problem... because they knew people care about this issue.  My point was, they're using this anger to get votes... while doing nothing to fix it.  The bill doesn't fix the things people are mad about... and really doesn't do anything at all.

> Apparently this time because of two trade ships from other countries even though these other countries said the US shouldn't send Iran to the stone age because of that.

 I agree.  But it's not two ships.  Iran just tried to overtake a UK ship within the last 24 hours.  And, within the last week, Iran has made threats regarding the UK/USA moving ships into the straight(which was done in response to Iran blowing up unrelated countries like Japan, and Norway's ships).  According to Iran, ""there will be consequences"".  Considering they're blowing stuff up right now, and hijacking ships... I'd guess more of that is what they mean by ""consequences"".

>But what people like the OP comment (I assume) are tired of are wars against concepts and wars based on lies, one of which Trump and his advisors are seemingly itching to get into.

I would agree generally.  We feel nearly identical about the USA, and the wars it's been.  My ONLY point was that this bill does NOTHING WHATSOEVER to fix the problem.  In fact, it makes it worse... because now they're going to hang their hats on this pointless bill until next election, so they don't actually have to make meaningful changes to limit the executive branch's powers.

In times of emergency, the president is allowed, both by written law, and precedent/tradition, to act.  

Two examples of this are the Civil War, and with Native Americans.  

Also, before the War of 1812 started, the USA was taking military action to protect its sailors, without a war declaration.  

>The reason why war declarations are being brought up, is because the bigger argument should be about what kinds of engagements the President is allowed to do when war is declared, vs. what kind of engagements the President is allowed to do during 'police actions.' You want to have that argument too.

Yes.  That's what people are claiming this bill fixes.  It doesn't even TOUCH war declarations.

Let me ask you one question.

It says it doesn't restrict his ability to RESPOND to an ATTACK.

There have already been attacks... on Norwegian, and Japanese vessels... the west is in agreement about this.  Therefore,  this bill does not affect Trump's ability to respond militarily to those attacks.  He even said, when he called off the first strike, that he may respond to them later.  

It's quite clear, with the language, that they aren't limiting trump's ability to respond to attacks... otherwise the republicans wouldn't have voted for it.  The only reason they voted for it, was so that in their reelection campaigns, they can say they voted to stop unnecessary wars in the middle east... when in reality, this ammendment does nothing to stop war.

You can still buy an AR but why do you need a bump stock to make it fire nearly fully automatic. The government isn't coming to take your guns they just rather you not be able to go on a shooting spree with them.  The military isn't going to break down your door and seize your guns because they don't care about them.  If you're afraid of some kind of military action against you and yours or a home invasion i suggest you learn proper weapon use. A trained person with a bolt action can easily defend themselves and their home without need to put 100 rounds down range.

It's going to take more people to vote for another party to make a change in the environment. I mean, 10,000 people voted for a dead gorilla and it made headlines. People don't realize the line at the bottom of the ballot is for writing in who you want. People could have voted for Sanders last time. But people don't pay attention. The libertarian party candidate actually made it onto the news' polls last time. 

We need to break this 2 party mentality, stop the official debates from being controlled by the 2 main parties, the libertarian candidate started a petition for being included in the debates, he made the signature amount but the people in charge of the debates still denied him from doing the debates since the debates are paid for and controlled by the main parties. We need to vote for someone else or bring them up enough to make it in their interest to bring them on. We need to start a rouckus about not letting others in on the main debates.

The only way to change the status quo is to vote against the status quo.

Also no one has technically been selected officially. Don't let the news and media keep you boxed in. You have more say then people today want you to believe. The ""US vs. THEM"" mentality keeps it in a box of 2. The idea of voting for someone you disagree with goes to the other person, or voting for a 3rd party goes towards the main party you don't agree with makes no sense. The vote you make goes for the party you vote for and takes it away from the party you don't want.

People think you have 2 choices. You have 2 choices made popular by the media. Look elsewhere for your choices. Not just what your told you have as choices. That's the point of voting.

Personally, I believe the exact opposite of the previous commenter. Expanding the Court and then packing it with judges handpicked for the express purpose of suppressing Originalism (or some other philosophy) or overriding the nominations of a previous administration would be an offense to the legitimacy of our Judicial review system second only to complete deconstruction.

Edit: Grammatical clarification.

Edit 2: Seriously, people. Consider the ramifications.

If you do this, you set a precedent for ever-increasing numbers of justices every time the Presidency changes hands. Furthermore, the fallout of this move means that Republicans would retake the next Presidency, guaranteeing another increase in justices based on the previous maneuver.

Tell me, how legitimate is a judicial organization whose rulings can simply be wiped away by capricious will? The Supreme Court is many things in its current form; capricious is not one of those things.

You would have utterly defeated the purpose of both the Constitution and its Supreme Court guardians: legal constancy.

Edit 3: Also, many of you don’t seem to understand Originalism. Originalism isn’t frozen in the late 1780’s. Amendments are considered to be fully incorporated into the *original* document, thus all protections extended by later Amendments are in full effect to the mind of the Originalist. For example, the Fourteenth Amendment would be considered inviolate to an Originalist.

Originalism also *does not* promote 1780’s societal norms. It is simply a interpretation standard by which the function of a law does not change based on what is viewed socially acceptable. For example, the Fourteenth Amendment took effect the moment of its incorporation, not when some random lawyer got around to being less racist."	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:09:43

I saw the same reasoning with Bush: he started it, let him finish it.

Look up how many people are actually accepted for Aslyum. Then try to line that up with all the people in this country or trying to get in.

CA has a giant homelessness problem and just now voted to give ILLEGAL immigrants free health care. These specific democrats are insane. Not all. There’s only two democrats I can even stomach voting for right now. And they’re not likely to make the primaries.

You’re claiming Trump for everything and that makes you delusional. Trump isn’t great. He says insane things sometimes. But he’s also done some decent things. The economy is great. Jobs are great. He didn’t start a war with Iran and he easily could have killed 150 people.

The first one is probably the most important here. While the president can't order military action without Congress only Congress can hold the president accountable if he does so anyway, if Congress wants military action but can't justify authorizing the use of force they look the other way.

Iraq and the drone program are good examples of this in action. The AUMF was intended to allow a direct response to 9/11 and would have been reasonably expected to only cover Afghanistan operations, Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 but Congress failed to do anything about the president exceeding the authority they had granted him.

With the drone program Congress don't want to explicitly authorize it because it's patently unconstitutional to remotely murder people without due process. Instead they ignore it when the executive hangs it's hat on the AUMF even though there are not enough drugs in the world to make words bend like that."	ccednx	2019-07-13 08:34:31

The downside is that the two party system, especially in modern times, results in little compromise and anything individuals of a particular party who happen to be in the right positions don't like can be shut down.	ccednx	2019-07-13 12:30:09

Instead, party floor leadership evolved out of necessity. During the 19th century, floor leadership was exercised by the chair of the party conference and the chairs of the most powerful standing committees. In 1913, to help enact President Woodrow Wilson's ambitious legislative program, Democratic Conference chairman John Worth Kern of Indiana began functioning along the lines of the modern majority leader. In 1919, when Republicans returned to the majority, Republican Conference chairman Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr., also acted as floor leader. Not until 1925 did Republicans officially designate Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas as majority leader, separate from the conference chair. (Five years earlier, the Democrats had specifically named Oscar Underwood of Alabama as minority leader.)

\* UBI, essentially free money, will drive inflation since undesirable jobs will need higher wages in order to entice people to do them. Since noone would *need* to work, the money offered would have to be enough to make people go. That means the services/products that rely on those jobs become more expensive, which drives up prices and taxes.

It does stop Trump from adding another war to the list of shit wars. At least for now. Better than nothing imo.

>That's why they made the bill, to get votes... and act like they were fixing the problem... because they knew people care about this issue. My point was, they're using this anger to get votes... 

I don't care about their motivation if they are doing the right thing. Repeatedly being evaluated based on their voting habits, should be the standard for congressional candidates. The fact that they might not get voted in again if they don't support this bill and thus have an incentive to vote for it, shows that at least some part of American democracy is working.

>while doing nothing to fix it. The bill doesn't fix the things people are mad about... and really doesn't do anything at all.

Again, it does stop the US from attacking Iran. That's a problem that definitely needed some fixing. A Dem House with Rep. Senate/Supreme Court/Pres. isn't suddenly going to reverse this massive issue on a whim. But at least they agreed to stop that retard from doing anything retarded for now, which is a win in my book.

> Iran just tried to overtake a UK ship within the last 24 hours. 

After the UK seized an Iranian ship that allegedly smuggled Oil to sanctioned Syria. 

>which was done in response to Iran blowing up unrelated countries like Japan, and Norway's ships

These claims are still quite unsubstantiated. I think UK and Germany openly sided with the US version but after German intelligence failed so ridiculously in the past few years, I'd take what they say with a mountain of salt. And the UK is known to Be the US' lapdog, so not suprising. Oh and the Saudis are also itching for some Iranian punishment, so we ae all in the best company there. And again, Norway and Japan already basically said ""no biggie"". I am sure neither of these countries would want the US to go to war with Iran over these two incidents where no one died. 

>I'd guess more of that is what they mean by ""consequences"".

Yeah and Iraq is harboring weapons of mass destruction. I will believe it when credible evidence is produced. Until then, US foreign policy of the past few decades kind of lost my trust.

>My ONLY point was that this bill does NOTHING WHATSOEVER to fix the problem.

That's a great point, but the way you laid it out and then whined about downvotes in a second comment just didn't quite land with redditors. If you care about Karma, you need to sell yourself and your argument better.

> In fact, it makes it worse... because now they're going to hang their hats on this pointless bill until next election, so they don't actually have to make meaningful changes to limit the executive branch's powers.

I mean, until the next election the Dems will hardly attempt something as ridiculous as trying to curtail presidential power on a massive level. Besides, we don't know what will happen. We live in interesting times. Maybe in three years we will look at these comments and not believe how pessimistic we were.

I despise Trump as well, but the people arguing against you have let their Trump derangement syndrome blind them to facts. Personally, I wish that Trump had some adults around him that could stop him from taking military action based on his impulses, but that’s a dangerous precedent to make.

This is how it all starts, is what you don't understand. You cannot think beyond the problem infront of your face and see the bigger picture.

Lets use Chinas social credit system. At first it was used as a way to pay for goods and services quicker and that is how it was sold to the public ~ 5 years ago.  Now, it literally confines you to spaces designated by the party in charge. Tracks every movement you make, the people you talk too.

So people gave up some rights for 'connivence' now are prisons in the own country. Funny, you know what would give the people some power? 

GUNS.

So, do you want to give up rights now? If so, please move to China and see what it's like and report back, only if you don't become part of the organ harvesting, due to your social credit score being too low. Which again, a handgun alone could help someone get away from that.

3476	1563048268.0	I doubt the good would outweigh the bad on this one and the argument for it seems like the arguments against congressional oversight of the executive. Tell the courts what they can and cannot hear cases on does a couple of things. One it turns that equal powers thing on its head and two it would create chaos if there was no recourse in different cases. For example, the many abortion cases that get brought to the SC every year, each state passes its own laws and then the Supreme Court basically shoots them down. Eliminating the courts role in that would mean restricting women’s rights	ccednx	2019-07-13 22:04:28

Plus it would be hard to ignore the heavy casualties and equipment losses even for Fox. Deal is the US has no way to deploy ground troops on Irans borders so it would have to do an amphibious landing from the Persian
Gulf, which would leave the navy extremely vulnerable to Irans coastal defence craft, AShM and aircraft. Just a few of these getting through the US defence screen would spell disaster, the loss of a US warship would be impossible to cover up and result in heavy casualties.

The GOP may not adapt to *progressive* voters.  But if as conservative voters change (and they constantly are), the GOP must change as well.


You have to look at the populous as a spectrum.  There are far left people, far right people, and a million variations in between.  Democrats are trying to formulate policies that capture the left as far to the middle as they can.  And Republicans are trying to formulate policies that capture the right and as far to the center as they can.  They are both trying to get a majority even if it's a very slight one.  If either party moves too far to the left or to the right, they lose enough people in the middle and they surrender power to the other side.


Neither party can afford to just refuse to play by those rules.  They've got to give the people what they want.  The only exception to that is when they do what happened in 2016 and they both promote very unlikable candidates and the people have to choose from two bad choices in a presidential election.

If the people he represents no longer support him (i.e. if and when he no longer has the support of 50 Senators) they can publically withdraw support and make him no longer the Majority Leader.

There's no reason for it be constantly reinterpreted based on the evolving world. That would be subverting and undermining the literal foundation of the government's structure by doing so. Just to use the 2nd amendment as an example, when the Founding Fathers set out to create that amendment, they only knew of flintlock rifles and fairly basic artillery (basic compared to that of the Napoleonic era and nowadays even.) They didn't predict chemical warfare, fully automatic machine guns that could mow hundreds of men down in a matter of minutes or even seconds, and tanks. However, with that being said, it's not up to the people of the 19th, 20th, and 21st century to decide ""no more guns cuz Founding Fathers didn't know."" Rather, it's up to the government to amend the constitution to decide how the right to bear arms is laid out as is the process of amending the constitution. 

Take for instance the 18th and 21st amendments. The government decided that alcohol was no longer allowed and the requisite states ratified it. A decade later, the government and requisite states decided they no longer liked that. If you want to modify how the constitution operates, it needs to be amended rather than just a group of nine judges deciding what's what.

Unions were the best thing to ever happen to the American worker, why are Republicans against them?

National parks were created by unquestionably one of the greatest Republican Presidents to keep America pristine, to pass on the great outdoors to future generations, and to create jobs for working class blue collar workers; why have Republicans abandoned one of their core beliefs — conservation?

Why are Republicans trying to systematically dismantle the systems put in place to help others like them? 

Why are Republicans complaining that taxes are wage theft and the middle and lower classes are paying an unfair portion of taxes, but then consistently voting for people who not only increase their taxes, but give an unfathomable amount of tax cuts to the obscenely rich and mega corporations?

Why has there been an increasing trend towards disbelief in proven scientific facts among the Republican party?

Why the increase in tribalism? 

Why the complete and total abandonment of their founding moral beliefs?

I think the move to institute an 18 year term limit on the SCOTUS with a 2 year appointment interval is much better and safer and a long lasting protection that could also be done via a simple federal law because as you say these aspects are not laid out in the Constitution already.	ccednx	2019-07-13 07:41:14

3641	1562998453.0	"You’re right, President Obama was just hoping to get by on the tradition of the Senate always just rubber stamping Supreme Court nominees. That ended when the SC started ruling by fiat with the Warren Court and deciding the most controversial issues of our society with 5 or 6 unelected justices. Thurgood Marshall famously said his judicial philosophy was “do what you feel is right and let the law catch up”.  This kind of subjective legal interpretation on the most heavily debated issues was bound to begin causing friction between the executive branch and the Senate. The Dems actually started things with the rejection of Robert Bork who was extremely qualified. 

I think the honorable thing for the Republicans to do would have been to give Garland a vote and just vote him down, but they had no legal obligation to do so, just as the Supreme Court can refuse to hear certain cases and the President can refuse to appoint persons to open vacancies such as cabinet positions or ambassadors.

3670	1563061206.0	"I'm sorry this just isn't an accurate representation of why the second amendment no longer holds the government accountable.

Yes, allowing private citizens to own fighter jets and cruise missiles would absolutely make it harder for the government to make unpopular decisions, however it would also completely destabilize the state. Every decision will be unpopular with someone, and everyone with enough money to support a large force would use it frequently to throw their weight around. 

Which is why the second amendment *never* guaranteed private ownership of weaponry for the purposes of holding the government accountable. It only guaranteed it for the purposes of running a militia, a group which would be subject to the orders of the president. Even the right to personal gun ownership is a *relatively* modern interpretation, as part of a precedent where black men were disallowed from gun ownership in the late 1800s early 1900s and then Supreme Court overturned those laws.

However five decisions completely eradicated and perverted the right to bear arms over the last two centuries:
 
1. The Whiskey Rebellion of 1791 was a group of men, largely from the south, who refused to pay taxes on whiskey they produced, and took up arms against the government to prevent doing so. Congress ruled such action illegal, and authorized the president to treat such rebels as enemy combatants. So the supposed second amendment right to bear arms against the government was invalidated only 15 years after the union formed.

2. After the Whiskey rebellion, and extending into the war of 1812, Congress decided that a regular standing army was needed for national defense, rather than just militias and wartime conscription. This was despite massive public distrust of standing armies and many arguments that an army was unconstitutional. Militias were slowly supplanted by the regular army, and by the 1860s were all but gone for national defense purposes. Invalidating the rest of the second amendment.

3. During the early days of the civil war secession was ruled illegal, and militias were temporarily disallowed from forming. This meant that the federal government had the authority to remove the right of individual states to bear arms against the union. Removing the last bastion of hope that any tyrant could be removed with second amendment rights. Not even a coalition of states could depose the government without total war.

4. Between 1916 and 1920 a major reformation of the standing army occurred in response to world war 1. For the first time in history the United States had not only a defensive army, but an army which could be used to wage war abroad with large scale new powers assigned to the executive in response. Militias were now completely abolished, supplanted by early forms of the army reserves and national guard.

5. Following world war 2 an entire restructuring of the United States economy and political system occurred. Numerous new state agencies were formed, with various levels of power over actors who owned or used weapons both domestically and abroad. The red scare meant that guns were both much more readily available to consumers, and simultaneously it was more suspicious to have weapons. This built us up to where we are now, paranoia and commercialism perverting the second amendment into something it never was: the idea of safety from the Boogeyman."	ccednx	2019-07-14 01:40:06

Retaliation for an attack, which I've said in multiple comments is a reasonable expectation from a first strike. A strike on Iran might lead to a war, but is not itself a declaration of war.

>You’re literally saying that slapping someone in the face isn’t a start of a fight.

I'm literally not saying that. I am figuratively saying that. Yes, it is very possible to slap someone in the face and not have that situation escalate to a full blown fistfight.

If you disagree, find an attractive girl in a crowded bar and say something vile enough to earn a slap. If you don't hit her in the face, you've managed to be slapped without starting a fight. Congratulations."	ccednx	2019-07-13 09:40:07

If one party controls the majority in the house and Senate and the president, they can rubber stamp all fucking day long if they want to. In this scenario the Senate majority leader choosing what gets voted on is pointless. The controlling party would simply only pass the votes they wanted to pass and turn down what they didn't.

If party A has the house while party B has the senate, party B can choose to not pass those bills they don't support. This is true even if they are forced to vote on every bill.

The only way the party B majority leader preventing a bill from being voted on would change the outcome is if the bill had enough support from BOTH parties to pass but the party b majority leader prevented the vote. Or if voting on the bill would reveal to your constituents your stance on a subject, in this case the leader is used as the focus of ire so that incumbents in challenges districts have a reduced risk of pissing off voters (Which btw is exactly what's happening).

That is one person taking on to them power they should not have and was not elected to wield.

Simply put, if enough of our elected congressmen vote for something to pass (or fail) it should pass (or fail) because that is literally how a representative democracy works. If you dont agree with how your representative votes... Then elect a different representative.

>  Originalism is usually contrasted as a theory of constitutional interpretation with Living Constitutionalism. Living constitutionalists believe that the meaning of the constitutional text changes over time, as social attitudes change, even without the adoption of a formal constitutional amendment pursuant to Article V of the Constitution. Living constitutionalists believe that racial segregation was constitutional from 1877 to 1954, because public opinion favored it, and that it became unconstitutional only as a result of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) – a case in which they think the Supreme Court changed and improved the Constitution. In contrast, originalists think that the Fourteenth Amendment always forbade racial segregation—from its adoption in 1868, to the Supreme Court’s erroneous decision upholding segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), to the decision in Brown in 1954, down to the present day. Living constitutionalists think racial apartheid could become constitutional again if social attitudes toward race evolve. Originalists disagree and think race discrimination will always be unconstitutional unless the Fourteenth Amendment is repealed."	ccednx	2019-07-13 08:52:09

I'm not saying that's a good thing*, I'm answering your question of ""if it's a bad law, why would a majority pass it?""

That can be either corruption of a system (like now, where a small vested interest gets policies in their favour that are bad for the majority), or it can be manipulation of a majority.  Persuade everyone that X is bad and should be banned, and they'll vote that way even if X is actually good for them.
Both are cases where a majority passes a bad law.


* Having said that, separation of powers was very deliberate.  The idea is that we need a check on abuse from one person/group having unlimited power.  By splitting it, each area holds the others in line.  It has the assumption that if shit gets real, they'll put aside their maneouvering and work together.

It would become a fact of the legal system and would influence later legal actions. It doesn't make it an objective truth but it absolutely does mean in a legal sense, judgements would need to be made in relation to the new fact of the legal system that Americans are retarded.

I think there is a a part of that that is true. Anecdotally, I don’t live in a liberal part of the country but am friends with a lot of Dems. Most are very centrist and seem to almost reflexively agree with Dem politicians because of the repugnance of Trump and the Republican Party. So for instance they’ll swear they aren’t for open borders, but just want those with criminal records etc to be the priority for deportation etc. Again that’s something a supermajority probably agrees on. The difference of opinion comes with what to do with illegal immigrants who are otherwise law abiding both here now and those who continue to arrive every day. There is probably a vast difference between the parties on this. But I don’t know hardly and Dems who would adopt the position that 17/18 of the 20 dem candidates have taken that there should be no real consequences for illegally entering the country and that all those who do should be entitled to the same benefits as citizens, ie free education healthcare etc.	ccednx	2019-07-13 09:52:10

This wasn’t my area, but I’ll give it a shot.  If it where Russia and US in all likelihood you are talking about a full exchange of all fast response weapons, ICBMs and SLBMs. France and UK would fire as per NATO agreements.  The US/Russia would have  4000 ( +~ 500 more from UK, France) weapons between them. These weapons range from 500kt to 20mt. Nagasaki and Hiroshima was 15-21kt. Some would be knocked out of the sky but most would  hit their target.  All major cities and military bases/ports would be destroyed. As well as military fleets by nuclear torpedos. Since nato military bases are spread fairly evenly across the US and through the northern hemisphere there would be no area unaffected by fallout to some degree in the northern hemisphere.  Even if neither country does not get their long range bombers off the devastation would effectively end all major countries. Asian countries may survive an initial strike but fallout would quickly become a dire issue to health and food stuffs.  That level of strike would definitely cause some level of nuclear winter following the exchange and further killing more people.  This would all be localized to the Northern Hemisphere.  

Most in the Southern Hemisphere would survive.  But you can imagine with most resources gone (northern hemisphere has most of the natural resources) the Southern Hemisphere would see a huge decrease in Food and oil. So they would be back to the 1700s.  And probably start resource wars.

If India and Pakistan had an exchange I believe that all other countries would stay out of it. Even if this means some citizens of other countries where lost. But this probably means total loss of Pakistan. Assuming they are capable of launching most of their weapons. I would have my doubts that Pakistan could effectively assure India’s destruction.  I could be wrong and both countries could be destroyed.   This could bring China into it also, if that happens I think the likelihood of all countries releasing weapons would also happen.  Fallout would devastate the whole area, and severe environmental effects would affect the entire world especially the Northern Hemisphere.

But that’s why we have MAD. Nobody wants everyone in their country dead, which is what would happen if a country attacked another.

I worry more about Iran. Their stated goal is the destruction of Israel.  This would take 3-5 weapons. They likelihood of Iran striking them is much higher do to their political system.  I cannot imagine that US or Israel will allow enrichment beyond 50%.  Iran is a bad actor, and I believe major conventional strikes on nuclear facilities is all but guaranteed.

People will always try to kill people but by all means lets just say fuck it and do nothing to stop it.  As for your birth right that's bull and you know it no right other than the right to life is a birth right.  I wasn't born with a shotgun in my hand i had to wait until i was 18 to legally register to own one and to register to vote. Had to wait for 21 for a hand gun.  So that's gun control.  Having to take a safety class for concealed carry was gun control.  Not being able to openly carry in California is gun control.  What's your argument here.  That because a piece of 200 year old paper says right to bear arms for a well regulated militia that any attempt to limit access to tools capable of massive damage is unconstitutional.  I rather we get rid of multi round rifles and implement mandatory recertification for firearms ownership than say the founding fathers planned on us having 600 round a min rifles as a birth right	ccednx	2019-07-14 01:09:32
3973	1563068718.0	"It’s called an amendment, you may have heard of it? Now, it didn’t shake out exactly like Jefferson suggested here of course.. but the general concept remained, changes just have to pass through the house/senate/state process. 


The idea of amending constitutions at regular intervals dates back to Thomas Jefferson. In a famous letter, he wrote that we should “provide in our constitution for its revision at stated periods.” “[E]ach generation” should have the “solemn opportunity” to update the constitution “every nineteen or twenty years,” thus allowing it to “be handed on, with periodical repairs, from generation to generation, to the end of time.

Additionally, 14 different state constitutions provide for periodic convention referenda. Yes these are just state constitutions, but the point remains the same. Everyone with a decent brain understands that times change and things written even 50 years ago should not be considered infallible or beyond scrutiny"	ccednx	2019-07-14 03:45:18

3975	1563070402.0	"> That said, the emperor being superlatively important wasnt exactly a secret. Thats like, THE thing you learn about 40s japan. They were the crazy asians that worship their emperor like a god. It was pretty central to the clash of cultures between western liberal democracy and the authoritarian axis. The fact that the US didnt think to mention they had no intention to execute the emperor was one of the most costly oversights in history. 

I think another factor was the US' experience with Japanese behavior during the war, their treatment of US and allied POW's and conquered peoples.  By 1945 the average American viewed ""Japanese culture"" as consisting of near-psychotic brutality to those under Japanese control and a near-psychotic suicidal death-rage against those they couldn't torture and enslave.  

With many Americans viewing the Japanese in such a fashion it makes sense that figuring out how to appease Japanese sensibilities would be rather low on their list of priorities."	ccednx	2019-07-14 04:13:22

3978	1563059758.0	"How many people do you think, can shoot someone at 25 yards with accuracy to kill? 
Its a LOT less than you think and your numbers are not even correct, you just used the first few google results (which is why 

Guns are not dangerous, people are. Stop putting your emotions into a non-self thinking physical item. The item does not love you, hate you. It just is. 

See you are the one getting all worked up and emotional, which is, hilariously sad and why people like me will go to our graves fighting for guns and all other birth rights.  You are your own worse enemy.

In the future, have an intelligent conversation without getting to the end and using very emotionally charged words in an attempt to make your point, which if you have it use them, makes it invalid and you will have a chance to be heard.

3981	1563060352.0	I'd rather go down as someone who fought for human decency and attempted to save lives than someone who makes excuses everytime some wacko pops up and kills a few dozen people.  No how many kids died at parkland or how many had to hospitalised in Tucson or the body count for Vegas.  So go ahead pretend they are outliers and any attempt to stop them is a violation of your rights i just hope you don't have to live through the phone call of having w friend murdered by a bad guy shooting up a coffee shop or a guy that's not right gunning down your kids in class.  Just because anything can kill someone doesn't mean we shouldn't try and stop people from getting their hands on more effective killing tools.	ccednx	2019-07-14 01:25:52

Funny how all those supporters of less and less guns always have armed guards all around them. 
I am done discussing this with someone who is just a ball of emotions.
