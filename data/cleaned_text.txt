The closest thing fighter X-, IIRC Iran claimed hacked taken control one ( landed Iran) Afghanistan - years ago.Predators like bombers dogfighters.It's completely implausible. The Global Hawk strategic ISR platform - *expensive* throaway, compared drone platform use stage provocation attack. Furthermore, Global Hawk collecting Iran, *need* Iranian airspace - , strategic ISR platform, conducts mission hundred miles away. All rendered moot fact specific model Global Hawk shot variant designed monitoring ship movement - highly unlikely even looking anything Iran begin !" rights" interesting phrase. Would agree USA "within rights" declare war Iran response Iran firing US military vehicle? Because technically . Shooting another country's military equipment understood declaration war. Likewise want damn sure invisible lines sky sea comes defending sovereignty. Generally speaking people's approach intercept violators send strongly worded diplomatic dispatches. You shoot think side violating territory intent attack. You will notice despite close borders Russia USA never took pot shots 's aircraft cold war knew difference fuckup cartography invasion.The US lied Iran Air Flight .I've hearing Iranians claim nautical miles shores airspace. The international standard matches sovereign waters nautical miles. I've found anything verify , allows parties telling truth.>war time Presidents often get reelected. I suppose Afghanistan count since start .I think , just small escalation, US will likely now respond. It just backs sides corner peace really possible long term.It's . Anyone calling action probably understand asking . Are willing pay taxes pay war? Are willing go ? Are willing put children front line harm's way? I'm going say answers questions NO every. Single. One. Of beating chests. Maybe willing change Facebook status photo, maybe willing say "support troops." That's though. Before promote war, take moment think really means men women carry . What want sacrifice really willing sacrifice. I've army years fought wars sucks. Everyone "supports troops" long convenient cost anything.I think will. Trump downplaying accident, indicated another Middle EastThe US slowly building assets looking reason push another Middle East war. A lot stems missile research. Iran doesnâ€™t much way ballistic missiles capable reaching US capable reaching Israel. So short due fear Israel PM clone Trump practically comes political division likely start war costs Americanâ€™s lives sake saving Israel. Also, John Bolton effect also lead us Iraq. All war machine black gold. America canâ€™t take care itâ€™s feel need interject policing world point beyond . Money, Greed Power...John Bolton.This comment displays fundamental misunderstanding Iranian government works. The title "President" Iran mostly figurehead functions face Iran international community. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, actually holds role Commander Chief military.Iran's president charge country military. He's like cabinet secretary, elected.A sovereign country honor protect sovereignty. If claim true wrong . In fact, look recent events, US trying start war.Prevented? The US military flew aircraft airspace. What fuck Iran supposed ? Imagine Iranian drone Manhattan - youâ€™d expect get shot fuck .I canâ€™t help wonder degree control country. I canâ€™t figure gain bombing ships.The Republican Guard loose cannon control. This shootdown just makes likely behind mines .That poor robot. May robot wife robot children find peace.If drone airspace deserved shot . I expect government, capability.How Iran? Are flying drones US border? No?Nope. This invasion US. If country flew drone US airspace, best believe US shoot . They'd probably start war , Iran's MO.LOL please Russia, Iran matter, started trying fly drones Washington DC (pre trump \*sighs\*) threatening invade think just lol ? They'd shoot anyone blink.It drone trespassing sovereign territory. This nothing. It drone. Not even live human.How prevent US flying drones airspace attack ?Iran clearly acting bad faith. They emboldened Democrats " war cost" mantra. Ironically, people like Bernie Sanders may *cause* war emboldening Iran carry attacks thinking America resolve deal appropriately. Deterrence ensures peace. Bernie liberals done best tear capability deter attacks. The blood will hands.How think trump going react? You can see just robot, parent president US. Heâ€™s power hungry lunatic, heâ€™s going something itâ€™ll lead war.Yeah, going harsh tweets.I doubt will retaliate. He want war take far shooting drone get point. But things keep getting worse, possible becomes bullet point speech mobilizing troops.As .But Bolton part Jared's Middle East peace plan?They want avoid US response much humanly possible. I think makes sense US easily destroy regime.No mention Trump vilifying threatening Iranâ€™s sovereignty? He literally started provoking .It seems like best course action scenario deescalate . Provoking US can lead sanctions, full blown conflict. Neither benefits regime.There plausible deniability mine. Not drone. You can find exactly drone missile came .I mean, I assume difference US regularly within X miles airspace whereas thereâ€™s good reason Iranian military X miles Florida. Othersâ€™ explanations make senseTrump supporters literally said Hillary start war Syria, Trump person people want war lolDid Trump declare war something I missed ?....We arenâ€™t war yet? Iran just shot $ million dollar drone havenâ€™t immediately annihilated , say something.Remember Trump's supporters consistent beliefs? Serious question.Might one things countries disagree international waters begin?No one "defending" Iran. Most people distrust US version story absolutely precedent governmemt deliberately falsifies stuff justify war.At least eager hand nuclear weapons.> international airspace This main point contention Iran US. Maps treaties say , international airspace, US recognize lot Iranian airspace.You say like pointless imperialistic wars nationalist thing ever.Or China Pacific carriers. Or Russia bombers coast Alaska. Any country militaristic aspirations . Not saying good, certainly widespread behavior.I think key point " region." It's like Iran flexing coast Miami.Gunboats vs. however many Arleigh Burkes carrier battle group. Not mention capabilities Nimitz carrier. I think odds DDGs favour tbhLOL battlegroups side world. This equivalent Iranians patroling gulf mexico. They thing, even fucking close.Its also worth mentioning US refuses recognize Iranian airspace region years, despite UN brokering regional compact matter. The US constantly tests contested borders.

And facing coalition around nations. In case Iran, maybe - gen behind, US fighting alone. I think still end US victory, easy first Gulf War.Of course weâ€™ll win, cost? Weâ€™re still struggling dealing Iraq Afghanistan, near level Iran.Long range cruise missiles one sole tactical advantages US arsenal. We several dozen region, dozen within weeks via submarines surface ships - devoid risk considering anti-ship countermeasures Iranâ€™s possession. These several dozen impacts sufficient make substantial impact military industrial capacity. Damage reparable within weeks, days. As comparison Iraq, Iran technologically, numerically, militarily superior every way. Also, Iraq flat, ethnically divided, military unmotivated devoid vetting, supplies, discipline, morale - still fighting . Iran suffers none problems. Also, manned aircraft cost tens - hundreds millions dollars piece, plus million+ dollar value life training now-KIA pilot. This drone multimillion dollar piece equipment. A missile costs grand American money. What youâ€™re describing textbook definition losing attritional campaign. I completely agree existential threat posed Iran mutual. The worst ( I believe likely) achievable outcome us costly stalemate. The potential outcomes Iran far dire. I believe supremely motivate pursue battlefield nuclear weapons Turkish assistance, even necessary.I hate use word "dumb" I agree . Iran superpower, reasonable definition term. Military spending perfect way define superpower status, I think can agree Iran, [\ world (behind Brazil, Canada, Italy) count.Their sole regional rival Israel, hasnâ€™t balls touch unilaterally fifty years.I think Iran anywhere comparable Iraq. Unlike Iraq, Iran huge arsenal potentially thousands ballistic missiles underground bunkers. These bunkers apparently every province city Iran. Iran also three times size Iraq geography, mountainous rather open desert. Iran's military likely qualitatively superior Iraq terms morale. If remember Iraq War II, Iraqi military, including elite Republican Guard, mostly deserted disappeared, lot high level commanders bought CIA. Iraq's military focused oppressing Shiites majority population. Not Iran. I agree, US will win conventional war. But degrade Iran's capabilities conventional war cost trillion dollarsThat figure entire annual military budget. Under circumstances ever bring capacity bear Iran, anywhere else matter.Nothing. Only morons think war Iran going happen right now. With Iraq, decades provocation BS Saddam. Otherwise, going , understood give power Shia majority establish government .

Simply put, cost geopolitical involved deploying nuclear weapon threat far outweigh benefits gained intimidation. It never happen.$,, drone throwaway ? The production versions MQ-C deployed yet, deployed demonstrator aircraft used develop BAMS varient.So point. The drone war just way avoiding human casualty, make low cost.

The US retaliated making quick work Iranian platform naval vesselsIt's , one declare wars bother occupations anymore, just bomb leaveWith possible exception UK, European forces largely PR purposes recent wars. Even support Europe I believe American forces vast bulk fighting, operations, logistical support. I also find extremely unlikely US launches ground invasion IranThe value coalition mostly ensuring international support fight, actual strategic assets manpower brought irreplaceable. And easy first Gulf War really saying much: ground invasion lasted just hours.Thatâ€™s true. Long range cruise missiles huge advantage, well dozens within hours bringing Iran range. But theyâ€™re advantages. Most Iranâ€™s air defense system anti aircraft artillery rockets, famously shown Gulf War entirely incapable stopping modern air attack. All Iranâ€™s air defense system missiles outranged cruise missiles fired ships, air surface missiles US aircraft equipped . Itâ€™s hard shoot plane missile theyâ€™re firing missiles twice range . And itâ€™s impossible knock sky can fly max altitude anti air artillery. Iran doesnâ€™t much way anti ship countermeasures outside littoral waters, US Navy keeps ships. With amount guided missile destroyers region, guided missile stores nearby allied countries, Iran struck well hundred times cruise missiles tempo even began slow. As argument comparison Iraq, , thatâ€™s exactly said Iraq air campaign started. And itâ€™s also just true. Sure technologically, Iran holds advantage existing years future youâ€™re comparing . The rest completely false. The Iraqi military , men, fully mobilized strength almost million. / regular army combat veterans. Fully mobilized, Iran can field little less , men, almost none combat veterans. **EDIT** Stop editing posts I reply .Israel really cares Iran fact Iran supply terrorists build missile silos Israeli border always threatening 'Wipe Israel map, death america death Israel'..

Retaliatory back forth ramping possible nuclear proliferation? Where can go eventual war?

Iranâ€™s anti air capacity includes far AA flak - I think assertion manifests majority anti air defense wildly inaccurate. Speaking anti air batteries alone, familiar Sayyad later iterations? As + cruise missiles, I believe thatâ€™s fair staged estimate fully commit theatre resources. Do believe enough significantly weaken defensive industrial capacity? To comparisons force strength w Iraqis, numbers point official estimates, I strongly believe Iranians much higher potential initial continued mobilization.

Iran nothing gain, U.S. , much gain political industrial terms. Do fooled WMD sequel.Wait, referring Saudi Arabia, esteemed noble ally, Iran, scum world troublemaker?> I canâ€™t believe youâ€™re willing side country stones gays, lashes women, supplies terrorist organizations United States simply dislike Trump. I think assumptions I ever saw one comment. Well done.[deleted]The motivation satisfying John Bolton's war boner. Secondary "benefits" include helping Saudis ( Jared Kushner owes shitloads money) distracting public.Can provide substantiate claim ?Iran legitimate government, theyâ€™re ones trying drum support war like US I willing support country plays hardball USI mean purely statistical standpoint ISIS actually lies far less Trump. And just numbers. They largely tell people assholes asshole goals asshole motivation actually lie . Whereas... well yeah, Trump lies literally majority time says anything.If locals ISIS, yes. Do believe unicorns?Iran's credibility hand, just impeccable.If actually follow everything closely, done pretty much everything said way back campaign. So pretty credible.So many people aside trump stating international watersWhat undeniable fact Trump personally trying deescalate ?Yes current situation Iran just another reason perfect walk away deal. Donâ€™t blinded hate dislike someoneâ€™s personality, donâ€™t let cloud judgement.Do even hear ? Why U.S. need fly reconnaissance drone strait begin ? The strait miles wide. The incident flipped equivalent Iran flying reconnaissance drone miles coast Florida. Heck, since strait thin, drone even closer, like miles. What U.S. situation? You people one sided view military provocation. So, U.S. can put troops border country, fly drones miles coast country, etc. etc.? But, country put troops border Mexico, fly drones miles coast Florida, etc. etc. America flip shit attack without hesitation. Do see double standard ? America got mad Russia putting missiles Cuba miles away. What think happen Iran flew spy drone miles coast U.S. border state? Give break. The U.S. clearly playing provocation games paint Iran bad light can go kill everyone get oil instate pro American puppet government. It's disgusting plainly obvious.Interesting blame Iran ongoing investigations Iran named culprit. Also interesting think Iran, knowing full capability U.S. military, want go war us. Are people serious? Who stands gain war Iran? We know win. The U.S. gets establish puppet government pro America bends knee American interests. We get natural resources oil Iran. Consequences destabilization region room ISIS . rise power . The pointless deaths innocent civilians American soldiers. The list goes . Regime change America's responsibility. It worked past, will work . Any idiots want go war Iran can go Iran fight . America provoker , I will sit idly America decides bomb million civilians Tehran stupid drone getting shot . Warmongers disgust . You sir, disgust . Iran poses threat U.S. Until I start seeing Iranian jets military personnel Mexico, I give two shits Iran shooting drone. And America fabricating attacks oil tankers oil facilities. It obvious U.S. trying . Yet, people want another Iraq War.Because clearly part US wanting start another. Same story WMDs Iraq failed attempt start war w/Venezuela. Or failed war Vietnam iirc shady beginnings. Bolton said believes ok lie things. zero intention abiding deal. They took money, laughed face.

AFAIK fact tweets sent came account posting things consistent authentic account really point contention. It's explanation every bit non-Russian investigation confirms. The coverup evolving denials changed fit new evidence just demands much mental gymnastics buy . If Russia truly find victim far-fetched scheme, need recognize diplomatic denials despite facts past created well-earned reputation. Explanation demands substantial departure rational thought needs substantial amount evidence justify stance. Instead clarification Russia offered obfuscation. You're bemoaning fact resistant world contributing making seem like anyone Russia accepts plausible deniability.Right .The "common people" still support war economy. Everyone guilty participant modern war. The Americans perhaps since vote . Bro I'm just stating far casualties United States got involved Ukraine. No one ok people dying. Da fuq?Almost years ago North Koreans tested Hwasong- ICBM stayed aloft minutes. That means can hit almost anywhere US including DC. The US GMD interceptors ( interceptors capable shooting ICBM. The US will almost assuredly salvo fire interceptors get close % chance success possible. This means NKs launch icbms. They estimated enough fissile material around warheads. It's easier build problem US buy interceptors run $ million pop. $ million means $ million additional NK ICBM. I want roll dice.No one cares & State opinion let alone.Ok cool still gotta back facts like everybody else.Keep mind people like Bashar al-Assad exist day. Just itâ€™s years mean people nicer .Oh look, tankie trying minimalize Allies's role war. Historians will also tell USSR crushed US shipping munitions, trucks, steel, materials needed th century war.

While bit egregious issue, like USA gets claim sovereignty entire goddamn planet put soldiers tech wherever hell want. It's years ***still*** Iraq Afghanistan.Lots research development. When projects take years lot times decades recoup cost. Cutting edge military technology isnâ€™t cheap either. Lots rare/expensive metals/ materials.Agreed, unarmed drone collecting intelligence one volatile regions world sounds like pretty good use DOD money . Not sure place cut money pay homeless.If arenâ€™t mutually exclusive, explain paying one ? Itâ€™s proven fact cheapest method combatting homelessness literally just providing houses affected. Thousands veterans homeless. Americaâ€™s military spending insult embarrassment.In fact, argue drones decrease homelessness indirectly, decreasing usage conventional infantry.Looks LA pledged billion dollars Olympics record number homeless people dying streets.This blatantly false statement, attitudes like part reason US large homeless problem.Not give homes!Thatâ€™s assuming give resources first place. Thanks Reagan!!!st I know mean 'people'. I'm Iranian. & nd Trump brought troops region explosions blaming Iran also proven linked . Even japanese ship owner denied 'mines' caused explosions. & rd st time US brought drones Iranian territory claimed international airspace. The US full shit fact take word ridiculous. What's even ridiculous US shot Iranian commercial plane passengers. Something I deem fucking BS unmanned drone. I bet Iran shot aircraft passengers near US border, different reaction. & I'm american I love country. I hate wars. I hate dumbass politicians wars. I hate America acts like World Police, act like bully. I like Trump, fuck start wars, I really give shit office. This just way wartime president keeping seat. Something evidenced even twitter years back. & So act like US innocent . We track history provoking companies, especially OIL. Saudi Arabia can kill US citizens & journalist, humanitarian issues, kill tons innocents Yemen, Donald Trump helping THEM build nuclear reactors, exactly Iran claiming ....Ah. I just looked apparently shot RQ- Global Hawk ever made. They supposed cost million costs increased number units cut . I guess F- cost couple billion ever going made. I initially thought predator something.Lol F sunk cost fallacy defined. Thatâ€™s just scratching surface crown jewel military industrial complex.Guess rest post. Like I explained, large enough military one less drone matter. We plenty , cut military spending half still twice many drones, tanks, aircraft carriers munitions next leading military power.

Some anti american group walks country thats fresh getting carpet bombed government overthrown America probably going get supporters. The reason muslim extremists hate america partially due disruption affairs. If stop destabilizing region, issue may just take care . Either way provoking violence region, come suprise may return violence.I donâ€™t think understand history region cold warâ€™s affect Middle East. Or implications US invasion Iraq. Foreign powers wonâ€™t stop destabilizing region. ISIS taking Iraq like south succeeding US, white supremacy taking , killing minorities donâ€™t fit new idea world. Sure people welcomed idea ISIS first. The US overthrew government left, ISIS one providing food security. Itâ€™s way tactic gangs use gain power. Provide security disenfranchised people theyâ€™ll say. Not long ISIS took power, majority people region started hating .Because people US can evil. Everyone else cultural fighting survival colonialism excuse. These people capable rational.That's Eurocentric bullshit. It birthplace civilization. The Empires Persia/Parthia/Sasanian lasted centuries. The Islamic Golden age. / better option? 'se s ignore majority going Middle East. Clinton let attacks attacks happen got worse.

Well last years worked Taliban really seem losing ground. The problem concept nation Afghanistan stronger people west rather actual inhabitants Afghanistan. The guy living Afghanistan just wants herd sheep, manage crops fuck wife. He give damn runs government frankly government fucking irrelevant . It gives nothing, . There sense national identity economical linkages beyond village/tribe level force need abstract concepts national unity. We've just force-fed concept nation states liked think bestest world fucking revolves around us ( really just due economic interests, dealing nation easier group tribes villages). > We must support Afghan government Taliban. If means leaving people advise planes/drones bomb Taliban . An Afghan government never form different culture different society different beliefs different values. You literally need years trillions dollars ( mignitude trillions war btw) investment education infrastructure **maybe** bring sort government want thankfully suggesting fucking bombs.And proof Iran given? I argue burden proof people firing missiles.The global hawk need enter Iranian airspace missions. It's highly unlikely crossed international waters.Iran also says airspace bigger actually recognized . Something else keep mind.And proof Iran offered? The fact drone landed international waters, designed watch ships international waters, leads one reasonably believe international waters.Yeah, according Iran gay people exist. It takes real fucking idiot buy nonsense.And Iran doesnt seem evidence remains drone used images years ago drone shot yemen. If land, I figure theyd images instead using ones years ago. If shot international waters, explain Iran doesnt wreckage. Funny US "provides evidence" Iran totally right eventhough dont seem drone anything left . Loving pro Iran approach reddit pushing months. /sThe drone shot straits hormuz Iran claims territory recognized internationally UN, countries perspective right.I'd trust spokesperson captian Pentagon vrs reigme listed sponsor state terrorism, trust , international airspace I've got finger pulse thisAre going give credence country just bombed tankers apparent reason?

If want take cover silence hundreds thousands people analyze track data. You silence crew support units run Moon landing conspiracy cost silence people takes fake landing takes actually just land moon. There drift tracking can determine far tide carries wreckage time recovery crews get ( spy drone will recovered). The moral *generally* speaking " hear hoof prints think horsey Zebra". The simplest answer right one. Conspiracy theories often work US government struggles normal things collaborated planned cover one uncovers nearly impossible inept political system.A Japanese boat captain disagrees. Germany UK agree likely Iran mined tankers. Iran also attacked oil tankers last month gulf Oman. Have noticed pattern ?Germany Japan disagree Iran attacked ships. They question type weapon used whether Iran possible perpetrator. They just want third party investigation will show evidence. Also UK Australia independently verified attacks intel. "And international forces saying Iran building forces" talking ? There ban Iran building forces course sort building forces like everyone else . I'm even sure claim making . I'm taking one source. You claim U.S. "one source" like entire U.S. one united voice everyone wants agree . There multiple videos boats attack. There left residue attached mines, magnet mines. Forensics can done show used attack can likely trace back perpetrator. They also fingerprints. There overwhelming amount evidence attack. Unfortunately, one can trust Trump Bolton tough believe saying Iran whole military saying Iran often agree . On top U.S. intelligence community insists Russia interfered help Trump get elected vehemently denied true. Let's pretend everyone making claims behind Trump. You find credible sources actual evidence disproving claims Iran. Again bring us war never happen ignorant happened just Trump dubious U.S. terrible track record Middle East.From [ article:]( > The EU said yesterday video enough blame Iran, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said **Germany still evaluating evidence coming conclusions.** Thats "agreeing US." Do sources **support** claims instead disproving ?Lol fucking dumb. & They provoking shit Iran. Acting like area around . They trade, anything. The EU even following accord, fuck Iran abide . They pretty much treated like North Korea huge hypocrites. & Meanwhile Saudi Arabia killing journalists (US Citizens) massacring people Yemen. Imposing worse humanitarian issues within country even slaves impoverished countries.I think misplaces billions cash way funnel money CIAThey absolutely care money. At end day budget cost entire F-.Are moron?How far rabbit hole go? Maybe lizard people? That's exactly lizard person say!Its just dollars, losing capabilities. There particular drones existence right now, like can just go Walmart pick new one.There potentially hidden costs million production value, I think risk potentially giving Iran (perhaps small) chance get good look tech used droneThey still going blow hundred million dollars tech reasonIt's size fighter jet holds sophisticated software reconnaissance, surveillance, navigation, communication command/control remote location possibly hundreds miles away.It's surveillance drone, want design high endurance. It range , miles cruise speed mph ( kph). Here picture size reference. cost million Because military contractors basically get set prices.

Their assumption , degraded global environment, can take much outright hostile acts provoke full US smackdown I repeat: ? Where's gain? The killed one drone, woo-hoo. What benefit give ? How improve anything meaningful? At best "neener neener" taunt US, I one see anyone stupid enough gamble war something petty. >, see US struggling domestic international support, ** worry Russia China. In , equivalent event led war within hours; , fact question US will go war * * fact enough Iran's strategy completely insane. Really? Iran Saudi Arabia past blew us airliners full civilians. So Israel. Remind went war .Do math. A drone exploding miles earth going travel laterally miles.Yes I . I also know miles lateral , feet vertical seems unlikely. That said, mentioned, I'm lousy math. If someone mathematically prove possible I'll cede point.Buying US story international waters hard since map. Edit plenty airspace maps publicly available, really depend US government tell everything.If buy US government's propaganda matter, believe thing flew miles shot miles ground international space. Why give government free pass lie citizens? Americans supposed smarter/tougher .Except US well aware Iranians capability shoot drones; since Iranian SA- shot Reaper drone Yemen. Why fly something within ranges missiles knowing will fire? This US antagonizing .Simple physics. Itâ€™s drone service ceiling , ft, likely around , ft mark likely cruising KIAS. If shot wouldnâ€™t just fallen straight .What international airspace goes Iran? Maps region quite clear: drone flight path fishy. See : USA *never* lie something like ! /s (sad I mark )Do article states debris fell Iran?Because clearly international waters, drove boats , recovered pieces aircraft, scattered ground. Clearly. Apparently second clearly enough emphasis sarcasm.. -_-First shoot missile empty oil tanker tell everyone Iranian mine, now unmanned surveillance drone gets shot Iran telling everyone international airspace...

You think used fly country's ground bases collect information? Stop ignorant.Not russian, shoot Iranian commercial flight late 's...killed civilians iircOver US airspace? None, Russia knows . If one fly airspace (especially recon drone), yes shoot use excuse fund wars.Mate shot Iranian civilian airliner airspace. We overthrew government supported dictator years. We sold Saddam weapons, including chemical weapons precursors, Iran Iraq War. How many times American government lie start war idiots catch . We lied gulf Tonkin. We lied WMDs. We lied Iraq killing Kuwaiti babies. We lied Maine. We lied Lusitania carrying weapons. We lied Mexico attacking American troops American territory start Mexican American War. But just eating government line doubts. How dumb .Yes, correct. America bully provoking war self-interest.Did miss weeks, months years leading ? Iran provoking shit. This US. In bully analogy smaller kid slyries shove bully, face, away. Bully yells " hit first" proceeds pummle .Correct. This first time done , hopefully will last.So can say sure US trying start war without knowing flying international waters Iranian airspace? But I say sure I know ? Accusing someone action hardly "trying start war." Stop exaggerating. No one benefits war.Anti American skeptical fuck actions current administration. We know fact least one man hell bent going war Iran serving trump. I'm extreeeemeeely skeptical attempt drum support military intervention Iran. I'm waiting around Colin Powell break poster presentation showing hiding WMDs. We already played game. And people conveniently forgot fucking bankrupt nation left thousands Americans maimed killed. No thank . Fuck . Fuck every last bit . The un-American thing thread anyone raising alarm bells . You might claim 'well slowdown nobody calling war separate thing'. It's . If left unchecked I absolutely see progressing crisis. We know want. We know good business. It's good reelection. Tell . Tell current government isnt crazy enough .

So even remote suggestion heading path people protesting streets. Never .Any repurcissions will lead response Iran will lead response U.S leading WarDefinitely , Trump reportedly ordered administration "tone " Iran rhetoric referred tanker attacks "minor" recent interview. & With said, Iran clearly stepping provocations attempt see can get away ...The international community will respond point...Do think smart let Iran's actions go unchecked? & What happens Iran nuclear weapons? What happens scenario Iran nukes, something piss ( say execute hundred thousand minorities, implement sanctions.) And decide - announce - going bomb U.S. Aircraft Carrier retaliation, anything nuke us. & What happens ? Clearly better us watch thousands sailors perish watch millions citizens perish. So allow sink U.S. Aircraft Carrier? & This really, really important stuff. Flippantly saying "war bad" recipe disaster. Appeasement recipe disaster. More nuclear-capable nations recipe disaster. Allowing nations attack U.S. military assets without recourse recipe disaster. & No option good. But one action ( inaction) may result ending humanity one day. So really *think* situation. Doesn't look like international airspace strait, anywhere near . Edit: I checked several flght maps. All show none. But I guess blindly believe media.[ understand aviation control zones work. The map linked ( now removed) outlining "control zones", overlap international airspace...Sensing things.. obviouslyThis international airspace. Russian aircraft comes right border time merely intercept aircraft. Attacking aircraft international airspace illegal.I think missing part Iran claiming flew airspace.American Exceptionalism - Which means everybody follow rules except us.They deliberately missing point. The people US want another war effects war US economy politics.Good thing drone boat... plane operating International airspace certainly Strait Hormuz & [ time America shot Iranian passenger plane Iranian airspace killing civilians.What stops Iran attacking something people next time just look way since just robot etc. If Iran's airspace one thing. If international airspace something else completely different.Lol. Where I say go war ?Sure. In situation, U.S. send aircraft intercept drone. That's happened numerous times Russia. However, illegal U.S. attack drone. That I OK .You trust Trump administration, just got caught lying tankers even ? Also, just fucking robot. Who cares? We'd shoot one came anywhere near troops.Where's proof international airspace?Suit get line fire, . Do .Assuming one believes story. I sure . Never forget US government going bomb Miami start war Cuba s. I reason think supposed drone attack even happened.Are Olympic gymnast? Why mines vital trading strait borders Iran?So calling escalatory crap unacceptable war actually happens? Edit: really itâ€™s Trump Iâ€™m worried .

Who knew.The sitting POTUS literally delusional, US running concentration camps, openly talk war Iran, incredulous list long type probably one brainwashed alt right dirtbags even debating good faith anyway I really see much point discussing . In eyes US credibility days, like fucking none.Meanwhile Trump filling cabinet defense contractors lobbyists.This true. The UN, I recall, sanctioned first gulf war. However, public really care much time, period rest world expected US lead things, really . Now state constant war since , rest world now holding us much international "police" work , face , many nations actually benefitted supported time. We're tired war, thrown many resources many American lives efforts vaguely defined healfheartedly justified. I think getting lot comments rushing deem Iran right, . We've just taken advantage many times based highly biased picture events. It's just natural response, whether Mike Pompeo forthcoming . Iran may well completely fault, need now just assurance president cant even tell truth crowd size faced photo evidence. There's credibility gap.Somehow un-american know talk president's track record.Go fuck . If face face, one us bleeding right now.So either , . You never answered question.Yours classic case whataboutism, hell, lets go! I"ll match scandal scandal, lie lie. I'll even start: [Trump Inauguration Crowd Size]( Your turn.

Edit: What, got anything worse?All I saw link fucked French revolution tried . And treated natives pretty good considering murdered, tortured raped settlers many times unarmed. They nature loving flower children. Manifest destiny technologically advanced culture absorbing much less technologically advanced. There travesties sides. We started war fight slavery, abolished . We put country risk abolish . And still fighting war slavery world, even though always end better. And cmon Russia just threw lives German army defeated, cared little losses. Russia suffered enormously hands Stalin. They never allies us, proved happened war. Without US, Britain France gone much strife loss. And yeah countries bad histories, US pretty fucking good. It experiment democracy gone SO much worse million ways, nothing short miracle succeeded keeping dignity. And honestly bottom line , looking black white thing, reality much complicated. In service I've locals literally bow shake hand I'm American war torn town, know I murder children. They welcome us WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS. I've seen things real bad guys , nothing can say will change mind. We perfect, wars past many times bad outcomes, always good intentions lot lives saved us. I expect understand dimensional view world politics. You can move anywhere want. Why stay country dislike? I almost guarantee come crawling back like many expats I know lol.That I agree , itâ€™s foolish think invasion even table right now.I doubt Iran detected ? It flown away. Iran anything gain .> said *unprovoked* attack I guarantee CENTCOM make statement like military forces another country without checking higher command. "Was shot HH:MM time today", even "Was shot ground-fired missile Iranian territory" neutral, factual statements. You can choose brush rug, respond minimal neutral facts, escalate situation something like happens, CENTCOM chose escalate developing situation another country. That's national policy decision. And unfortunately, United States longer credibility national level.The Intel good. The Intel said , saddam nukes. He wmds. Bush took Intel, spun .Congrats brainwashed believing US government savior worldclearly... & American diplomacy: "I'm touching , I'm touching , I'm touching , I'm touching , I'm touching , I'm touching ..."[removed]Imagine believing Trump "leader free world". Also Iran isnt really dictatorship, democratic republican institutions even illiberal.You give anything respond , just inserted point killing civilians ignored I said entirely. Yes, geopolitical equation changed since election aggression Iran merits different response now versus later.Obviously peaceful solution best reparations first priority, refuse pay , I can support limited retaliation strike military target given option evacuate right . This IF drone proven shot international airspace.So saying ? They admitted nuclear talks FFS. If developing weapons needed enter treaty whole world?!It includes AAA, majority air defense system AAA. The Sayyad S S effective anti air assets. All multiple generations behind US tech. Not launchers missiles obviously outranged ship launched guided missiles, theyâ€™re even outranged US plane launched air surface missiles. And made bit misnomer said Iran + â€œsystemsâ€. They + *missiles*, much limited number launchers. Far fewer launchers US cruise missiles alone. Yes, I think cruise missiles alone devastating damage air detection, air defense launchers, power grid, command control centers. Not enough destroy Iran, enough cripple ability stop air sorties US. And happens US aircrafts flying range AAA dropping massive amounts ordnance every secondary target. I donâ€™t know youâ€™re basing belief . I say ground forces significantly less capable Iraqâ€™s invasion Kuwait. Not I think matters, conventional army canâ€™t fight without air superiority.We President Trump .And now EU talking imposing sanctions Iran breaking deal . The thing came fruition link still working Iran goods sanctioned.Um , Only US Israel claimed broke deal. Just every independent watchdog foreign intelligence agency said complying.They broke deal Trump wiped ass lmaoMinimal.

They really wonâ€™t threat THEY GONEThat's totally fine. I just understand rhetoric US BAD IRAN GOOD threadsUnderstood. As right now Iran saying drone airspace commander US air Force central command saying point flight path drone violate Iranian airspaceThe core issue Trump supporters really racism bigotry. Invasion Iran deaths untold numbers Muslims serves purpose. As long Trump "stopping illegal invaders" demonizing transgendered will support .If Iran's chunk sky, , need justify . My point flown drones airspace numerous occasions. When shoot drone claim airspace, far fetched. When Bolton et al try act completely innocent beat drums war, suspicious fuck. And I know.

Edit - forgot word.So I'm kinda curious decided ? I'm sure political boundaries complicated, looking seems miles coast standard territorial boundary. So happened miles Irans coast, Iran claiming airspace US claiming get standard miles territorial waters?FWIW, The last time debate came , Iran telling truth USA three year cover just protect crazed Admiral murdered civilians. I trust Iran automatically either, anyone trusts anything coming Trump administration willfully blind.Yes, clear whether international airspace Iranian sovereign airspace. I just want know actual facts situation, sides believed time incident.Why Pentagon doubted? They produced quick evidence, instead gave laughable. When later evidence eventually released, harder trust will plenty time fabricate, good explanation release good evidence initially. Also, look big picture: Due corruption incompetence illegitimately elected pathologically dishonest President, even Secretary Defense place right now, Secretary State known liar, top advisors well known massive frauds complicit war crimes. That exactly inspire confidence. History also tells us USA top bottom will lie three years murdered civilians irresponsibly aggressive Admiral violate Iranian territory shot obvious giant slow moving civilian airliner. I trust Iran. Nobody . But thanks US currently situation run wildly corrupt extremist cult, trusted either.Iran shot drone may international airspace, close enough territorial airspace clear.

I gotta google , stupid hell./r/dontputyourdickinthatHe didnâ€™t respond heâ€™s glad CIA assassinating peopleWhy assume I meant americans whole?Itâ€™s far paragraph. Thereâ€™s voluminous photographs.Yeah, theyâ€˜ve free will since US overthrow prime minister seventy years ago. Everything bad done Iran , therefore Americaâ€™s fault.Why ask question US drone even near border Iran first place?How years ago? Or forget attack Iraq -, something nothing .[Yes I ]( No sarcasm necessary.Ah yes, Iran surely trustworthy country certainly never questionable conflicts.But drone allegedly international waters. Anyone allowed fly drone regardless country.We throw away $ million dollar aircraft *much* cheaper options. Turns Triton . It's also designed watch ships, land. The likelihood Iran one placing mines just shot . They want US collecting evidence.So lets look facts. The drone shot . Both sides agree. The drone question worth $ million. We handful . It slow moving defensive stealth capabilities, advanced navigation equipment known man. So opinion, intentionally obviously flew extremely expensive valued asset easily replaced Iranian airspace, shot . Yeah. Sure . And I'm sure think US bombed tankers earlier, hit Saudis cruise missile well. & What's really going hardliners Iran either become desperate, started believe propaganda think can actually take US Gulf. I want see war Iran, attacking ships aircraft international spaces going tolerated, likely see get put check.They're still executing people homosexuality charged today genius.Lol yeah navy drone outfitted ship recon missions ground Iran. I understand countries territory water, drones capable conducting missions hundreds miles away, theres literally reason encroach Irans airspace especially light recent events. Its expensive drone dont many, wanted incite situation used cheaper expendable piece hardware. Its likely Iran trying hide evidence guilt involving tankers shot drone knew theyd fucked didnt. This way can still capitalize newfound worldwide support blame US. Just guess, I feel like r/politics user just following marching orders. Thhe people will run defend north korea criticisms US "orange man much big bad"Weâ€™ve killed people North Korea little credibility.Okay yes, valid, I think sponsor terrorism back see viable allies strengthen stance world. I think regime change good practice, look recently Arab spring see bullshit Syria come . However, The US pay pensions suicide bombers families, yet alone pay anyone commit " unlawful use violence, intimidation, especially civilians, pursuit political religious aims." But besides point Iran crossed world sees CLEAR red line, international airspace respected matter . Cases like caused airline ~ people get shot ukraineHey man, I'm just saying id willing bet last dollar airspace. Take will I'm % confident. You wrong things, just seen something times mean paint everything brushAfghanistan approved UN based lies . Do idea talking ?Iraq invasion based verified UN inspection report. & Any proof rest claims?Probably. But US respect lines favor allies?[removed][removed]!Remindme weekThat's calculated risk different putting asset danger just justify going war. The done U- flights USSR shot . That's stealth driven must assumed undetectable Intel gathered worth risk. I'm sure tested several times first. So different. Every nation takes risks just always pay . Sacrificing just start war different get push back. Also people need keep mind. Iran violate UN law sea recognized every nation claims almost Persian Golf airspace stated shot international waters everyone Iran recognizes. Iran likes chear saying uninhabited islands expand territory. Look INCLOS explains . That states nautical miles continental shelf inhabited island.

The downvotes getting make sense, getting brigaded seems.Itâ€™s donâ€™t wanna put cost human life, numbers can often cost train maintain pilot capable flying types aircraft cost simply replacing aircraft. That may case particular drone, overall prioritizing keeping men alive potentially losing valuable military equipment usually ethically financially sound decision. Look happened later years WWII. By end countries planes ordinance pilots fuel needed fly , effectively planes .In pessimistic thought sure, people really get protective aircraftIf scroll halfway article, [ picture person next one]( They're designed air ~ hours time carry ton expensive equipment.A lot people make mistake military drones. You hear â€œdroneâ€ see picture one sky, think just small-ish remote aircraft. But many basically just airplanes -board pilot.I'm sure I belive frankly. Iran certainly lying, US decent history crying wolf middle east.Maritime aviation maps. It's pretty clear. It question. Edit, I add bit controversy long time back claimed . International shipping territory corridor.No; dont. You believe thing shot , feet ground, traveled miles? lol You can quibble individual pieces evidence want, put together make less sense simpler explanation.To get result happened use media fire public allowing US take action.The US Russia play international airpspace game "I'm technically touching " time. Occasionally media breathlessly reports "US Jets intercept Russian bombers Alaska" happen time international airspace. It's form gathering intel, recording things response time, response type, number/type responding aircraft, etc. So stun US edge Iranian airspace something similar, depending exactly draws line, / violation.OR Vice-versa.The US literally just attempted blame Iran attacking oil tanker. Where ** ?What makes sense, Iran shooting American drone outside airspace . Or Iran shooting drone inside airspace. Both sides lie regardless reality situation. So always work I generally go logically make sense. I see logical reason Iranians shoot drone outside airspace, gaining anything even really defending .For ? Shooting aggressive aircraft invading territory? The US exactly thing, except use excuse fund war industrial complexNot I said. However, USA clear aggressor . We tore diplomatic agreement. We massing troops, carrier groups, equipment area. International airspace extreme limited. And number hawks White House looking war Iran. So, I struggle trust either side. Which I find infuriating. I able trust government, I simply .Our government us. Most ( ) American citizens want another shitshow. We powerless. There good people America. I give fuck Iran, people . They people like . I've known many Iranians I love talk culture. A lot us like , I'm trying defend government fuck , fuck . I'm just human like . Edit: We'd lose. Even Trump want war first time long time, going essentially first world country. None, none us want .There international airspace Strait Hormuz. If flying Strait Hormuz either Oman airspace, Iran airspace. If drone Oman airspace, reported , since US needed flyover permission Omani airspace. Also, nautical miles = . statute miles. So answer question, yes.No I think itching confrontation wanted Iran shoot . You think "multi million dollar" means anything Pentagon? If neo-cons successfully get us war spending trillions.Yeah, paying attention troll.And Iâ€™m saying I donâ€™t know can make determination based information youâ€™re saying isnâ€™t available.

And, like border dispute, theres going lot disinformation aimed muddying waters. The fact remains US formally recognize regional agreement set boundaries Iranian airspace years ago. It stated much, numerous instances US ignoring Iranian sovereignty borders defined regional agreement.According [ article]( u\adverbera links later discussion, Iran admits incursion happened airspace, international airspace. I idea adverbera insisting Iran agrees happened international waters. Its downright lying.>) No, US certainly precedent ignoring country's territory surveillance purposes Okay, link + times US violated country's airspace purposefully countryIrAn SaYs>Thats outright lie. ask ...No, really. An extra troops sent region today. There arenâ€™t extra carrier groups moving Gulf. Bombers havenâ€™t moved, troops arenâ€™t mobilizing, etc. Any reaction will limited even happens.

So blinded rhetoric see horrific country's actions . Utterly reprehensible.The comments calling dissent "anti-American" especially telling.>I even said damn thing wanting us go war Iran, No just repeating defending bullshit gonna used justification invasion.

Times different , learned mistakes. And I presented wall facts lol, focus seeing modern social justice perspective inject virtue signaling can avoid seeing greater good. Its ham fisted approach history. Honestly giving US far much credit, like overarching comic book villain controls countries world. We goad USSR anything. They seized void power little resistance. For every example gave I can give bent backwards preserve culture, life dignity. I seen firsthand soldiers get fired upon hesitate * return fire* wary civilian casualties. We really try make difference. And every person shooting , basically cry relief seeing us * bad guys*. Should middle east? I know. Probably . But I DO know saved countless innocent lives work . And yeah I brainwashed. I used like America either, I grew I learned everything peaches cream, America lesser evil vast majority situations, getting better.It matter say. This person made mind matter will never consider anything else, despite acting like neutral.Can explain away ? CIA director, George Tenet said, "We said specific information types quantities [biological] weapons, agent, stockpiles Baghdad's disposal. According newly declassified NIE, intelligence community concluded Iraq "probably renovated [vaccine] production plant" manufacture biological weapons " unable determine whether [biological weapons] agent research resumed." The NIE also said Hussein "sufficient material" manufacture nuclear weapons " information Iraqi nuclear personnel appear consistent coherent effort reconstitute nuclear weapons program." Here's bush given report: But October , speech Cincinnati, Ohio, -President George W. Bush simply said Iraq, "possesses produces chemical biological weapons" " evidence indicates Iraq reconstituting nuclear weapons program." The first part lie truth, last part just blatant lie.If warmonger go enlist go kill people ? I heard pretty easy get .Iran broke deal.That article sounds like fucking Brietbart, come man.

That shoot also came heels months Iranian harassment engagement Gulf. It didnâ€™t just happen.I think bunching mutiple incidents one. It believed tankers torpedoes, missiles mines. There undeniable video evidence Iranian Soldiers removing mine debris tanker, one missile attacks done missiles believed used Iranian soldiers. America Britain (<- rd party) ( two nations voluntarily involved) claim Iranians responsible. USA Britain MUCH better track records Iran. Absolutely, people info better, denying Iran anything just foolish.> Iran denies involvement attacks oil tankers ( torpedoed) And Putin denies invasion Ukraine. Iran also denies holocaust gays exist.That changed substance inane comment way. You still need tell us "mass casualties" means, even relative sense. A war Russia might yield million deaths.

If going talk politics, especially area clearly well versed , emotional someone kindly points making correct assumptions. I'm open discussion, bonkers tangent nothing I said. If USA *NEEDS* go war ensure safety Americans allies, , course I hope never reaches point, I think anyone bit education matter knows will never happen. Iran want war, Iran wants total immunity everything . This fucked surrounding countries MANY MANY times history, now nations allies. Anyone nukes superpower... amount power hold nuclear weapons insane, puts table big boys (Russia, USA, China, Western Allies). The USA, Allies, rest world want war, want Iran held accountable actions, want restrict tyrannical government's power. Iran VERY powerful nation, also incredibly unstable, unstable government nukes simultaneously arms radical extremist militias TO FIGHT INNOCENT PEOPLE just worst case scenario , literally every single person planet. >Iran zero motive go war us. Pretty sure regime isnâ€™t suicidal. It suicidal, willing risk LOT, insane amount gain succeed. They either win lottery high chance success (gaining power), lose paid ticket (trying gain power). I doubt willing see side Trump's involvement , I highly encourage question pull besides assumption wants war. The Iran deal truly awful, reached JCPOA, negotiations took long, nullified half duration. It allowed Iran continue nuclear weapons research soon provision. The deal stipulated Iran conduct nuclear energy research timeframe (signed - ) provision Western Allies, Iran claimed already , change anything... proven false Israeli intelligence, showed Iran conducting nuclear weapons research guised 'nuclear energy research' programs. Iran even openly stated break 'new' Iran deal US Allies *within days*. Iran bad country, awful government leading ordinary people. There reason Iraq, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Oman, UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait Bahrain support USA Islamic Brother Nation Iran.The us POWERFUL Iran.

Either someone told incredibly false narrative even bother check facts, deliberately spreading hoax information.

In regards US footage, history fabricating evidence lying order start wars.These good points. Russia's invasion internationally agreed upon fact established though. This still developing. It just think anyone rushing conclusions rely US credibility.Calm captain America, numbers game . We talk hypotheticals.That seems question reliability, fair point. But accuracy still unknown since hard miss ocean. Another thing think also unknown number Hwasong-s. They estimated reliably make Hawaii Alaska, eat interceptors well. Again, I just want roll dice. All takes one making , say, Port LA/Long Beach cause massive loss life incredible economic damage.No, internet.I'm sure proud job honestly I think relevant context.I support war, just like done throughout history.

If saw women bruises body looks fearful life husband angry aggressive sees , changes friendly person bring attention much unless start meddle life. Knowing things can go worse possibly , try help get away abusive husband? Or just leave alone let situation get worse? You'd probably call cops try husband knows trying break apart. And cops ? Would just one patrol car, maybe couple, maybe know information husband bring team police situation go south? Would keep trying save situation know get worse ? Would protect husband came ? From written , rather let die hands husband just shrug say "oh, well. Didn't want get hurt ". & When talk collateral damage, much already happened? How many LGBT+, women, children, people government wrongfully accused crimes Theocratic oppression? Are government killing people sexual orientation, wife killed accused adultery evidence put forth, news reporter dug information wrong doings government thrown jail murdered exposing truth? That goes many countries like Saudi Arabia well. I support civil war SA create better, freer nation people. How many K deaths Iraq hands people terrorists bother fighting ? How many deaths counted coalition forces witness deaths evidence coalition forces never area deaths occurred? There multiple reports refuting claims Allied forces killed civilians accused killing cover either Iraqi's wrong- terrorists hand. It's amusing completely white wash really happened Iraq just want right. The Iraqi government keep government together Allied forces country trying help move forward. Terrorists able seize land different parties want even work take responsibility roles government matter much effort Allied forces attempted assist money security. They lazy stubborn take back country. We live world majority nations ruled one person hierarchy. We live time never peaceful history. We live time people feel free ever point history. And want argue dictatorship oppression fine? That everyone able liberty make free choice? As long oppressed, right? & And Iraq dealing consequences actions, . We gave time effort actually try make things better, failed time. The Iraq Government kicked everyone important matters, Obama decreased presence Iraq wanted take lead role governing matters ( made Iraq fucked overall) created vacuum one Iraq wanted take charge make Iraq prosperous nation. They fine oppressed controlled dictator. So Terrorists took advantage .

I just wish skipped live viewing.You poorly summarized history crisis Yemen. You make sound Saudi Arabia arbitrarily began attacking Yemen. Saudi Arabia's issue Yemen rests solely Houthi militia... guys flag states: "God Greater,Â Death America,Â Death Israel, Curse theÂ Jews, Victory toÂ Islam". Saudi Arabia direct defense Yemen's legitimate government military forces moment. Houthi fighters deliberately target civilians. I specifically use word target reason. While Saudi Arabia killed great number civilians course war Houthis, deliberately target . The can said US military. Try military may, nobody found way entirely mitigate collateral damage. This mean I agree everything Saudi Arabia condone killing innocent civilians. I'm merely attempting shed light sides. While every single instance collateral damage Saudi Arabia can expected make news, even hear proportional peep guys deliberately killing civilians refusing aid, refusing join cause, assisting legitimate government. These people fire rockets, launch mortars, shoot artillery, launch attack drones directly populated areas knowing danger puts civilians . Don't like Saudi Arabia? That's fine. I expect . But just ignore facts support side. As side note: If American, Israeli, Jewish I think probably cheer lesser two evils like Saudi Arabia. If Houthis way kill literally every last one . See flag confirmation. All aside, I'm wishing none happen. I absolutely love everyone get along want kill . And I like oil problem next guy either. But need better solution viable everyone. We need safeguard resource .You might want Google " timeline Iran". This really oil, enriching uranium Iran deal.It's like wants get iran back everyone's shit list russia can press cheaper oil.

Trump tweeted Obama starting war Iran just win re-election ( smart cool belief), I've bracing Iran war now.For real...Saudi Arabia sharia muslim monarchy. It goes fundamentally America stands . Why helping ?The Saudi national anthem "Onward Christian soldiers...".You just learned today? Wait til hear Dick Cheney. And Wolfowitz doctrine.

They strategic ally region useful American military. The fact sell oil American dollars great American soft power. There benefits relationship Saudi Arabia. There's also downside really share common values Saudi Arabia, like, . The common values start end mutual dislike Iran. If unfamiliar US hates Iran, Iran nationalized oil production s. In US government's eyes, Iran stole American companies invested oil industry Iran. This similar reasons behind Cuba embargo. Frequently, talk 'US interests.' That's basically code " good US business." I've kinda gotten track. My point although Trump fucking sucks, alliance SA start .As Brit, welcome club. We've since s.Ever hear Monroe Doctrine? odds sold missile, tooThe houthis Yemen claimed . But crossed mind. But reason weâ€™ll go war Iran despite Yemenâ€™s hitting back g starved.Either , .

I've really heard much talk . Then vague, "The missiles came north." Again unusually vague. Normally given precise launch area. Maps showing path missiles etc. Don't warships sophisticated radar going gulf right now yet none picked incoming missiles? And quite blue. Iran, far I'm aware, attacked neighbor unprovoked like long time. And , attack conspicuous target say, " us" ? What achieve attacking target denying ? If want send message kinda need people know . I'm saying Iran just I feel ill ease happening add feels bit contrived. And mention heard plenty president feels I've yet heard commentary Saudi leaders. Why president taking centre stage nation attacked oddly absent? Certainly one thing I deny current US president achieved make far deeply suspicious questioning world events. And right now two scenarios I find quite plausible, within realms unexpected: ) Israel manufactured look like Iran. They probably gain Arabic nations US going war good pulling kind underhand deceptive action. ) manufactured Saudis US look like Iran.

There's fine line considered conspiracy theorist merely healthily questioning untrusting leaders tell . But I'm afraid Trump embolden trust era live . He's made us feel way .

Itâ€™s also American oil facility. Why saudis capable protecting . They buy billions American military hardware .Reasonable ? Reasonable ?One: military. Two: got involved Vietnam. We sent thousand 'advisors', get attacked use excuse send troops defend , , war. Three: Saudi Arabia fighting war aggression caused attack, NO business supporting first place.The rational thing , country responsible murder , citizens attacked, say "sucks , ?" Not send another thousand citizens die .Yes, send soldiers shield people responsible /. Makes total sense.That , one possibility though American forces get attacked either purpose incidently, america gets locked Vietnam like situation Yemen. I put past trump declare war country Saudi Arabia committing crimes humanity .Because Iranians responsible . Yemeni rebels claimed responsibly . This pretense. After next yemeni attack kills even single American soldier, Trump will use justify war Iran. The Saudis need support. They plenty arms. The attack nearly bad previously thought. He's putting Americans harm's way naked attempt stoke war.But wasnâ€™t Iran... saudis known terrorist funding involvement Umm yup. Firstly, much US can defence systems sold Saudis stop . Second, whole fcking thing stems Saudis raiding Yemen American weapons opposed Iran US betrayed.Iâ€™m sorry? % worlds oil destroyed?

Kind big difference. Reports say facility will back running within month (CNN). I think weâ€™ll fine.Why US get involved? It hasnâ€™t even impacted prices.Why matter? Does retaliation increase oil production, prevent future disruptions, prevent price fluctuations, replace lost oil? In mind, expected outcome "stepping someone destroys % world's oil". (Not really world's, way. You can say actually , export Saudi Arabia.) problem dawg US got stop playing captain save hoe[removed]Destroyed % eh? Let's see source. I believe article said "temporarily knocked " %. That destroying . Why lying?

Most people donâ€™t passports donâ€™t travel internationally, exceptions sponsored go church â€œmission tripsâ€ deployed military service. What kind impression will average person Middle East people know went soldiers invading occupying army ( spent whole time getting shot waiting get shot ** part invading occupying army), rest comes Michael Bay fucking Sean Hannity? As recently ten years ago I guy. My cousins deployed Iraq I wanted believe good cause, I gravitated towards news sources told I wanted hear. When came home, one permanently injured, talking oil, really shook . My hometown home largest Yazidi population United States (many former translators Army relocated families escape reprisal), ISIS started way I appalled. I lot independent research learn much I know now, including years correspondence people live region ( chance encounter Facebook Syrian woman turned five years regular contact â€” I even flew Istanbul years back meet family person). She studying US Medical License Exam. Put years , hoping earn residency position . I got tell Trumpâ€™s travel ban happened. Her hometown (directly Syrian-Turkish border) repeatedly targeted ISIS car bombings. Most family, several I met person, still live . You look things region lot differently actually get know people live , footnotes news ticker translated phone calls see everyone still OK.

I feel like democrats country Republicans idiotic reason get people vote states system actively works voting.Ah yes, stole Bernie's popular foreign policy, intention following itWhat called Army?If American soldiers get killed - I expect Trump " dove" will suddenly decide wartime president good war go.I stand corrected thanksI think Ross Perot sort Goldwater Republican actually upset tax increases. I sort think Perot Tea party supporter , just fed EVERYTHINGBill got punished legally prosecuted long investigation produced enough evidence find guilty. Trump gets investigated time Democrats legally prosecuted enough evidence. If commit high crimes enough evidence prosecute , punished just like anyone else. That's law justice works U.S. You condemn someone just based accusations. > right care. Bit hypocritical guys stand . More blanket accusations based emotions rather civil discourse based reason. It's amazing left always seems know motivations intentions people's hearts can make judgements based . I'm often even absolutely clear motivations things, people can decide motivations . lol. Stick facts dude. Then can discussion.So Obama didnâ€™t give shit either people just want go full socialist will probably make US go shit. Itâ€™s expensive gas itâ€™s just going cause another war nobody wants Middle East. Theyâ€™re defense purposes. Theyâ€™re invade.Thatâ€™s exactly works anymore. The budget largely, almost entirely, executive branch. The executive creates budget proposal sends congress sign . Congress longer crafts budget hasnâ€™t done damn near century. Ultimately, yes, constitutional power purse, budgetary process much nuanced last decades almost seems like executive complete control budget. Itâ€™s actually fascinating read I encourage learn budgetary powers stripped congress th century.I think interesting case made Warren shares insignificant similarities Clinton merit discussion. They technocrats favor top changes, Warren currently funded solely grassroots funding indicated accept super pac dark money general, strategically minded inside players dem establishment. You absolutely correct Biden like Hillary method proported ideology Warren like Sanders, I think style governance theory change valid evaluation perspectives. None knock Warren, I like lot love see office Sanders make . I'm just saying valid perspectives identity ideology can compare politicians .Interesting. I cant find anything (based light research) says either two people ever worked warren. Also cant find anything CTR level astrotrufing warren campaign. Do sources?Makes sense.

Two sides coin...just one side crusty tarnished.>She's moral vacuum like Trump, Cheney. No. But Saudis still donated millions Clinton. It's like arms deals( forty, totalling million) Saudis Obama POTUS. I'm way condoning Trump, realistically warhawks gonna war. It makes money.Seriously, I understand people like this) I fucking hate Trump. ) While Hillary batshit, Looney Toons insane, still war hawk.My comments cite history facts point logical conclusion Saudi Arabia harbor . You claim: > Saudis harbored terrorists behind / So proof ? Just like liberals I come across, make accusations statements evidence reason. Instead, liberals tend condescend, belittle insult agree opinions.Okay, doesnâ€™t answer question. Saudi Arabia produces % worldâ€™s oil. If world supply shrinks amount, fact US doesnâ€™t import huge percentage oil Saudi Arabia doesnâ€™t bearing fact price will increase.Yes exactly. Someone idiotic worldview might say things like â€œHave , Moâ€Congress can change election, president can alone. Even "national security event" need approvedThe dudes even American. Just block move .I clicked user rabid response comment. Nice little bit projection end . Please carry internet tirade, fun read.I tend agree conclusion will hurt , especially given US wasnâ€™t directly attacked. A foreign war way different catalytic event **/** versus attack Saudi oil complex. I just pointing folks â€” primarily GOP war hawks â€” preemptively layered initiation military conflict political strategies, rather reacting threats legitimately surface. I canâ€™t imagine sinister backup plan pre-fabricating global-scale war.Could worse. Still wife. Ouch.The Bulgarian bus bombing one. I'll give . It's also one I know linked Saudi Arabia. I'll stand corrected . The Buenos Aires attack predates " last two decades"Where want start, / bombings, San Bernardino, Paris attacks, Madrid train bombings. The list goes .Hell, even boston marathon bombers Sunnis radicalized Saudi Imams. Name attack West, trail leads back Saudi Arabia. Every single time.So lets say % %... think game semantics. Is kind play time American lives? Seriously. Does somehow exonerate Trump ?I see disagree John understand part correct. And reply, A war started wrong . However, I know can start second mean war started. A small number troops sent defense, attack anybody. So war. It also noted Saudi one biggest partners US. This much Trump White house general. Saudi deep pockets White House since early s ever since US made deal Saudi peg oil fiat money. Seems like people like ignore . Ever since US Saudi working together make eachother powerful oil money Iran obviously one biggest competitors Saudi just like Iraq use saw happened . I think people realize bigger picture way distracted Trump honestly sad. If I guess, approved send DEFENSIVE small number troops just play cards right. But say started war excessive point. We need see now cards play will know real intent . But going act like know , fool. I claiming know . I'm just speaking non bias facts. But since Trump never listened John, I think hope will start war.No, example Trump igniter, person entire staff. The thing blame Trump will get nowhere. Trump knows decision made others take seriously, critiquing staff means never get critiqued just go usual.

When ever invasion pitched parties need spend time exit strategies vs enter strategies. Remember military officials job security push offensives. So presidents.Talk US sends , troops instead . We sent troops build wall southern border. This nothing. Saudi Arabia large enough military launch long-term war two fronts (Yemen Iran) US want war. Not going happen. Let's just say arguments sake can proven Iran send drones SA also attack US allies Iraq, Syria, etc proxies. They're already max sanctions. What course action take diplomacy work? I'm suggesting anything. I want war either. I'm just asking, respond?Bro economy country literally ideology. This grey area room debate. Canada socialist definition socialism.It's moot point. If US wants protract take nation, can theatrics. If want kill leadership overnight spy, can snap.

You can bet US pilots aircraft extensive training tactics established defenses capabilities. On side, many stealth aircraft think Iran available train ?

And course ground invasion, even eventually successful defeating Iran's conventional forces despite much difficult terrain opposition compared Iraq, still inevitably end quagmire insurgency make Iraq look like cake walk.That will still justify bombing innocent lives.

By denying large part people actually bothered vote voted youâ€™re denying root problem: lot US citizens thought still think presidency Trump good idea.It , one accusing Trump criminal mastermind. He's just criminal, supported almost entire Republican Party. His crimes visible, proof made public. Trump's defense eventual indictment retaining presidency, claiming presidency makes immune prosecution. His administration filled incompetents. Everyone competent fired quit Trump's willingness break law, idiocy, . Multiple competent ex-senior-staffers called variant 'fucking moron'.Wrong. Trump EVER shied away war.

If attack response military threats, whole country, meat bags risk death. That's USA, international community nothing Darfur, feels places middle east worthy war. If nothing done Darfur... affect us Europe/USA. If nothing done middle east, Russia/China/Iran gain control , can now expand directions, possibly, time, overtake USA/Europe, force submit will(like Europe/USA made Russia China submit will).If werenâ€™t technology couldâ€™ve future son/daughter shot absolutely nothing. Regardless itâ€™s person inside aircraft flying aircraft flown remotely - itâ€™s still part US military. Just one got killed - weâ€™re ok governments shooting US military aircraft ok sending oppo research?Luckily Trump pacifist, warmonger Hillary won boots ground Iran already.First line article says: "General Hajizadeh said even pilotless drones systems relay warnings communications operators thousands kilometres (miles) away United States." So probably just radio whatever planes use? The drone unmanned, still someone flying remotly afaik.ELI Version: The pilots drones (Predator Global Hawk-sized) listen radio frequencies airplane satellite communication. There two specific frequencies, called "guard" (.Mhz .Mhz) airplanes constantly listen , airplanes use frequencies distress, air traffic controller get hold airplane airspace. The Guard freq also used alert unknown aircraft approaching national airspace. & Until Iran nations within listening range (UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, US mililtary) release audio recordings radio warnings UHF VHF guard, claims Iran warned drone violating national airspace unfounded.The drone monitoring radio frequencies required operate section international airspace. So three scenarios I see : : Iranian US radio equipment malfunctioning user error preventing one side sending/receiving. : Iran broadcasted warning Iranian frequency aircraft flying Iran required monitor. The US, claims flying Iranian airspace, obviously monitoring Iranian frequency. : Iran's message get US basically like FU bro internationally recognized airspace. number seems likely use logic "hey OUR airspace monitoring OUR frequency."They warn drone English International air distress (. MHz). This relayed via satcom ground control station. It recorded responded predetermined script. All communications recorded logged future posterity/evidentiary purposes.A big drone like talking ATC way Nevada wherever. Sure set like commercial jet comes radio equipment.As far articles states, . I think must com. channel cases like .Yes. These drones utilize data links transmit receive information, case use tadil-J.Its referred guard call countries flying vicinity will issue certain frequency operators shelter (bldg dudes use fly ) monitor via radios internally attached inside drone. Iran normally agitated guard calls dont recognize NM boundary normally push (ish).They dedicated radios, directly aircraft well specific people controlling airspace (like AWACS nearby monitoring aircraft, etc). There's also international frequency used cases someone flying close border looks like going cross border. My guess Iran probably yelled frequency numerous times RPA get airspace, U.S. shrugged shoulders saying trespassing. It also takes time proper airspace requests go , RPAs really slow compared aircraft like fighters bombers even passenger planes.Maybe read article dipstickHow ? I think contradicted I wrong.I think checks either. Why initial retorts coming Iran mention warnings? This seems least strong defense "outside international airspace" claim.This trump's bullshit ineffective. His word meaningless. Everyone knows full shit.If drone international airspace, Iran's business.protecting allies shipping ships? It downed high traffic trade routes.TauntingWe dont need giant slow drone spy.Oh, I dunno, may getting ready launch guided ordnance towards Iranian Military targets? I doubt Iran knew "Spy" drone. After Tanker incident Trump saying retaliation, I'd think Military chiefs Iran want take chances.Because US become nation cried wolf. People around world sceptical US claims nation threat recent history proven lied things hard ever trust liar .Because Iran everything lose nothing gain war. US politicians hand...Because John Bolton, man helped sell WMD lie political resume reads like book pushing war Iran directly involved foreign policy He literally spent last years anti-Iran pundit fox news well There zero chance hell anything US say credible present administration.[deleted]Because t US stirring shit Middle East decades now looks like obvious excuse start yet another war.

Get fuck already.Because Bolton long history false flags USA cause wars around globe.> talking two sketchy regimes hahahahha\> Why many taking Iran face value? I'm apt side Iran drone clearly crashed Iranian waters. While possible drone crossed border shot , I think unlikely.Because U.S. offering compelling evidence counter . The limpet mine pics videos confusing. The crews said fired .Would also believe Iran claims P- people board ? Edit: clearly I grammarIâ€™m sure I believe one .

The US's history international lies far, far, far longer larger Iran's.How can blame international waters?So saying problem nation shooting aircraft side airspace. Or ok Iran ? You need help man.Youâ€™re correct. Iranian sources saying military aircraft far drone time, carrying passengers. Theyâ€™ve said shoot one chose .Lower still, can see.What talking ? The US released several maps showing exactly side story.How little research ? US provided coordinates, outside nmi Iran. turns President Whitehouse constantly lies even petty things eventually undermines US credibility. Who knew!?This pure ignorance bud. I'm dumbfounded Iranian support thread. Iran causing turmoil decades Middle East. Not mention atrocities committed people Iranian government. Multiple US administrations trying figure best ways deal shit. Even countries surrounding Iran telling chill Allies Middle East support us.

Irans foreign minister stated uncertain words, including exact coordinates, claim drone fired upon. Around nautical miles coast. There absolutely disagreement border . Iran claims nautical miles anybobody else, apart strait narrower, treaty Oman. So please source claims, stop lying.Youâ€™re implying tanker attack caused Iran. The evidence far suggests isnâ€™t true. Hell, Iranians first responders helping sailors. Making strait undesirable shipping hurts also.Source?I feel like even asserting Iran perpetrated attacks tankers rather much strong.US says outside, Iran says inside. It matters drone military power half way across globe blurry zone dangerously close shore.

One thing also keep mind possible Drone one point Iranian Airspace missile fired case. But missile impacted drone, outside Iranian Airspace.Hi ! I'm curious, different things play . UNCLOS defines nautical miles shore home waters - also additional nautical miles 'contiguous zone.' Now, I know sea law . I'm interested politics course, long ago, I taught territorial waters defined furthest cannon ball reach. Which funny. However, contiguous zone found Part II, section , article UNCLOS. And allows : . In zone contiguous territorial sea, described contiguous zone, coastal State may exercise control necessary : () prevent infringement customs, fiscal, immigration sanitary laws regulations within territory territorial sea So, UAV intelligence gathering within nautical miles flying towards Iran, US violation ?I'm sure consider mystery point time.They didnt agree plane downed> root cause behind drone strike tanker attacks. You idea root cause either aside armchair "common sense." america didnt act like world police flying drones side world issue. shit iran like incident fuck load closer US.>UNCLOS international treaties establish international waters anything nautical miles shore, Iran refuses recognize international standard insists territory extends beyond . It's interesting know ... Because know , USA military also know thatThat even matter case since within miles according Iran... ~~edit:~~ ~~Oh, looked shill, say pretty much fake news sources site random nationalistic Middle Eastern outlets, specifically ones SA Israel. The sources cited literally purely editorial articles, nothing written draw sources like agreements made Iran since comes gulf Hormuz Strait specificially, just bunch fear mongering posturing.~~ ~~I'm curious either old war affect young know war , pushing comment history.~~Not really I going . I honestly side Iran case. However, "news" warned us twice airspace .... news .This gives flashbacks working tech supportThey usually say American aircraft Iranian airspace turn around immediately. The times warn , angrier start sounding. There canned response international waters, however, standard protocol respond .So? You're talking country spends majority GDP military. .Oh wow, I hadnâ€™t heard . Source?Lol, something phrasing just reminded US shot civilian airlimer Iran blamed Iran . Crazy fucking worldBecause Iran want war gotten really good knowing fine line isWell duh, I expect nothing less Iran claim . In reality I expect NOT Iran's airspace rather international airspace somewhat close Iran's airspace. You may disagree action wonder close fact matter : They international airspace territorial thus right NOT shot . That's shoot Russian war planes come close Alaska, rather scramble fighters escort back.God damn Michael Bolton. He needs get jack sparrow obsession .Iran's trying provoke war, trying paint good light, plenty incentive forIran doesnâ€™t want war. They already facing domestic issues thanks American sanctions. Literally nobody wants go war U.S. But U.S Trump countries, doesnâ€™t care consent.Their greatest global impact disrupting oil channels. This brings everyone table.Nothing gain actual war, quite lot gain provoking U.S. striking , thereby mobilizing EU ( already ) brazen confrontational finding ways around U.S. sanctions. Which say happened, just clear incentive provoke U.S. taking direct action clearly labelled aggressor ( already breaking nuclear deal).[deleted]Using US domestic aversion war leverage bring back make concessions sanctions. They've also trying cultivate anti US sentiment home. It's actually hard see incentives dancing line know looking . Too many people just look kind zero sum game. Either war, nothing.They want provoke war also want economy tank economic sanctions. Right now EU world seems pretty content just waiting things real loser spotlight removed Iran. Very limited attacks tankers ( oil spill, human causalities) shooting unarmed drone will heighten tension without really giving cause war still enough tensions running high hopefully people can start negotiating.I absolutely believe Iran US I choose. The US deserves trust days running . Plus like said, want war ? Seems obvious.Iran want look like victim defender just shooting drone may may violating .In likelihood, Iran attacked oil tankers. It's pretty widely accepted, even countries want war taking place. So whatever motive presumably suffice motive . One motive simply : US left nuclear deal applied fairly strong sanctions Iran. Europe stayed deal, really done anything else. So Iran wondering still complying deal also feeling pain. They want back bargaining table. These provocations-- least oil tankers, ambiguous, though still refrained shooting drone even briefly airspace-- designed show current state affairs sustainable Europe needs reign everyone back . They want Europe US come back table deal sanctions. They course action mind deal sanctions act . They counting, perhaps, fact still post-Iraq haze, unable commit fully open warfare. Even US response ok Iran's mind, war, sort buildup precipitate talks. The sort attack planned Trump administration attack, war. And Trump trying start war, hesitated like . I think Trump wants war, I think Iran knows . Bolton's load trouble, done maybe fly surveillance drone Iranian waters, now least, Trump's tendency critical middle east wars winning . Everyone lieing different parts building tensions. Sorting pretty tough considering neither regime credibility.None. Which saying bunch stuff make people believe nothing wrong. Public perception matters.Iran trying send message sell oil will block strait Hormuz. They literally said publicly . They want war, want sell oil. If sell oil fucked. US sanctions actually working Iran panicking. The best thing think attack tankers Saudi oil send message, pretend publicly order save face.[deleted]What reason US fly drone Iranian airspace drone shot need penetrate Iranian airspace see deep within Iran?It's hard make argument shot drone "crossing" imaginary line.>I dunno, incentive Iran possibly provoke war? They know get fucked . Whereas Bolton salivating one. So I'm inclined believe Iran. They plenty incentive shoot drone catch blowing tankers.They're running options besides baitingIran perfectly knows chances war close zero. Meanwhile They trying something able sell oil seriously cripples . Provoking small scale conflict disturbing oil trade bargaining chip negotiation. That exact strategy North Korea following decades now.Iran's trying start war, trying flex. There's lot shows power full-scale conflict.wrg, bolten s just chicken hag draft dodger knows bark behind fenceGood thing President courage pull trigger everyone around telling .Further erode US' international standing hopes rest world will give economic freedom? The trick provoking war starting one.... current US administration playing playing fire soaked gasoline. Not saying North Korea pulls shit damn time effect.> They know get fucked . More like US stabs chest legs lopped .They hopes getting Russia step support preventing war. Also fuck America bolsters regime support country.I wouldnâ€™t say Iran get fucked America start. Sure, America versatile military Earth, war Iran end badly American presence regionâ€” presence mainly prepared defend militia attacks, one capable militaries present Middle East. I feel like Iran looking reason attack American forces area. Or understand America much lose region start war . Iran standing army around , troops, band militias operate throughout region, large supply ballistic missiles. Not mention, Iran probably receive large military aid Russia form anti air weaponry can almost jet missile available U.S. arsenal. Iran preparing American attack decades. So sure, America fuck Iran, take years carry immense human toll. Over ? Iran shooting UAV?I sure get fucked . After , US lost weaker enemies Afghanistan, vietnam...Iran want war course will lose political conflict within Iran. The rather moderate government one side radical religious leaders . The revolutionary guard less control religious leaders. While government wants better relationship world, religious leaders want tensions US gain power home.The drone vision radius likely hundreds miles. Why fly like dozen miles Iran's air space can see basically thing outside?Dunno, incentive attempt murder Saudi ambassador US soil bomb embassies? They denied Obama administration. So Iran thing realm possibility. What make sense timing. It's likely just distraction like lot things Trump . Look , avoid looking issue.Lol serious? dumb moronNorth Korea effect. Chafe sanctions, make noise threats explosions, get I international aid.>apparently Iran documented steps avoiding kind aggression Or claim.>Because US (specifically Trump) wants desperately go war Iran, I trust anything say . I mean, making automatic rule also seems stupid.If Trump wanted war, ratcheted tensions attacking Iran. Trump seems interested war. Iran seems making clear strategic play provoking relevant parties back negotiating table order ease sanctions. They likelihood attack tankers afterall. Ultimately, know happened , either story certainly plausible. Edit: "clear," plausibleNah Trump just wants saber rattle appear tough. He will back peddle conflict begins. It everyone else around Trump desperately want war.People keep saying yet done everything avoid . When preconceived notions going notice reality?I mean point believe anything ? Every post worldnews filled "That country pushing propaganda" "Damn bot everywhere" Maybe bots, maybe propaganda... Or maybe people different point view.Dude, seriously, comments threads absolutely ridiculous.So, people trusting nation want invaded destroyed millions people killed / displaced Iraninan propaganda. And people trusting nation multiple occasions invaded countries killed/displaced said millions countries, without proper reason.... trusting truth, freedom democracy - US . ?And go US? Sure, buddy...You trust without question, just accept might true consider side.If follow news Iran comports among neighbors doubt capable committing provocations lying . Not international news Trump headline.Tens thousands already apparently.Well slow ass missile. Iran posted flight path, never crossed line.Except happen multiple maps shown drone never entered Iranian airspace.. Nor need .Or: Aircraft outside recognized Iranian airspace, instead claimed ( claim entire strait) Drone ignores Iran warns Drone ignores Iran shoots drone spent entire time allied international airspace.This exactly happened.The US will flat ignore UN/courts, always .The "international courts" unelected just corrupt parties involved.According world bank Iran spends roughly % GDP military expenditure. civilized country hangs people streets petty crimes.They quite lot gain provocative creating tensions relevant parties back negotiating table order ease brutal US sanctions.lmao civilized huh? From Human Rights Watch: "Womenâ€™s rights severely restricted Iran, point women even forbidden watching menâ€™s sports stadiums. That ban includes Iranâ€™s national obsession â€“ volleyball." "The ban women sports stadiums emblematic repression women across country. Women confront serious discrimination issues marriage, divorce, child custody. Women sent jail publicly speaking favor equal rights women. Because government wants Iranâ€™s population grow, itâ€™s even moving ban voluntary medical procedures women can undergo avoid becoming pregnant. And thatâ€™s just beginning." "Itâ€™s just women repressed Iran. Anyone openly criticizes government risks thrown jail. The government also discriminates ethnic communities like Kurds Balochs, well people belonging Bahaâ€™ faith." let v Trump Rouhani. The fight will end till dead.Are crazy? Do know Iran acts region. They much provocative record middle east last years .Happy Cake Day. Neither credibility...Almost certainly will , escentially thing siding US.[deleted]They busy getting outraged properly readHe's saying terms starting war matter drone .And US Generals like: "Yeah, shit going shoot . That's sent first place."Iran also thinks entire straight , probably say every aircraft flying .My theory recent escalations benefit Saudi Arabia will ultimately control key countries around new silk road. Of course I total idiot, I looked maps proposed routes interesting countries near war happen strategic new silk road convenient Saudi Arabia, especially considering longer term economic forecasts (- years less global dependence Oil). Regardless proposed route, actual route go countries including Iran India. Edited add link clarify wording.I'm big fan 'The Grand Bargain' theory Seth Abramson: [ Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Israel get 'win' wars build nukes. Russia gets sanctions lifted exchange allowing invasion Iran. Trump makes money, US gets little.If MIC banner drone .

Allegedly also passenger aircraft legally airspace shoot , just drone.The drone cost $ million. It scrap metal arguably Iranians arent worth $ million govt.Yes. But US bring freedom, just like bring freedom Iraq Afghanistan Chile every country try make puppet regime. Like, realize current regime put US, right? As opposed regime overthrew, secular less authoritarian.The USA going bring "freedom". We've already road, road freedom.

The US, claims flying Iranian airspace, obviously monitoring Iranian frequency. I doubt . There international standards . even Iran went everyone else used frequency, US drone NOT want monitor frequency?Option : The drone deliberately flown iranian airspace. Either provokes reaction ( surveillance data associated event alone valuable), can monitor closer iranian inland. Both win US administration current climate. Deliberately violating sovereign airspace common tactic, btw. And unmanned drones, political cost low.> number seems likely use logic "hey OUR airspace monitoring OUR frequency." Wow, just saying Iranians complete idiots, best assessment.The US ignore warning operating accordance international law.

The US, however, im sure right now, also strange history starting wars unnecessarily Middle East... ***hhhhmmmmm***I honestly amazed guy said Trump said president America. I believe .The quintessential Murican. pretty hilarious, I must say!He called U.S canâ€™t launch first strike. They know . Itâ€™s geopolitics. Hell even warned Iran attack. They wanted Iran counter .Trump doesnâ€™t know fuck wants, attention. Trump ** government, party. He doesnâ€™t get thing like start war unilaterally. He ratchet tensions enormously, likely prompting warmonger advisors, I seriously doubt thinking anything , â€œlots people US donâ€™t like Iran, therefore I say bad things Iran itâ€™ll improve popularity people will pay attention .â€ He backing getting criticized ratcheting tensions itâ€™s unpopular ( general population government, including party), can damn sure hadnâ€™t gotten response backed . As usual, team made bunch noise without thinking real-world consequences now real chance people may die heâ€™s attention seeking idiot.I mean, Trump wanting war Iran wanting America look bad arenâ€™t exactly mutually exclusive scenarios.> In fact, drone shoot first place. We recon drones Strait watching everyone area prior Trump admin?You mean Iran blew civilian oil tankers sent surveillance drones watch one volatile regions world. In particular area Iran vying control years?Domestic aversion war means majority population currently looks disfavorably war Iran. You need quick try clever... .Starting war US absolutely benefit Iran. Unless believe can go toe toe USA.. laughable.Rouhani crazy... You're just imagining reasons believe US Iran, memeing bullshit Crazies Iran. Americans, seems, just prepared accepting reality base facts. America belligerent, Iran trying avoid war. Why shoot drone international airspace without warning trying get fucking country less belligerent. It's safe bet telling truths US government.Only, war US infrasturcture completely destroyed, millions civilians killed even millions displaced.[deleted]You trust country run man attacks press, claims owe election God called political opponents jailed. But one ?[deleted]Yeah country amazingly great right now, isnâ€™t ? You fucking lunatic running country, might oppressing different people different ways, still oppressive disgusting. Donâ€™t act like US sort holy country can wrong. Both countries fucked ways. That doesnâ€™t change fact US, apparently best buds journalist murdering Saudis, benefits war Iran. Iran knows theyâ€™ll get slaughtered start war. They lose therefore, moment, I side Iranâ€™s truth. Schiff Merkel going believe something Trump says just said . All circumstantial evidence points strongly Iran.[deleted]If shoot someone's drone, expect missiles shot back . That's world works. We airspace. We airspace entire rest world believe Iran's. The issue Iran different definition airspace works, entire rest world. The rest world recognize Iran's claim airspace.Honestly, I'm sure think tanker company idea blew .My bad, I meant S-, war Iran press early â€™s I see S- deployed Iran.AgreedThere's approximately % chance Iran avoid loss open warfare. Which sticking brinksmanship creating incidents level plausible deniability.Something-something Iraqi WMDâ€™s True, situation murky.The UK Germany shown evidence behind closed doors publicly blame Iran attack tankers. Between US escalating response $M drone shot , starts become clear wants escalation wants deescalation. Reddit just happens anti-america echo chamber.Protecting key trade routes attack sufficient. Iran never going directly strike us significant way taking drone, I know else waiting . say wants war idea . I actually think war help reelection. He campaigned idea sorts wars. He knows will brand sense will attacked mercilessly opponents almost media. His administration definitely pro-conflict, Trump dumb lost incompetent wanted war called attack last minute. Mayyybe want war, sure whiffed starting one week. Frankly just much talking ass say definitely say definitely .And yet new wars. Plenty adventurism prior admins, far nothing. In fact heâ€™s ended slowed stupidity. But I know many just hoping heâ€™ll something can jump say â€œI told !â€So love trust reddit admins now?Not things, fact Iran war vessels tagging civilian vessels. Even think framed attacks, military vessels close civilian ships km away territorial waters? This shit stop, period.Yes, people different opinions. Those thinks Iran behind necessarily redditors paid GOP bots.That point. My point basing trust Iran acted regarding nuclear deal foolish. If follow Iran's actions region, know hold credibility whatsoever, lot stories involved US tangentially mostThe fact powerful care UN UN still present day. UN tool force anything powerful.Probably just bonuses whoever puts PPV together.I pay much see .They're involved every conflict region. last time something like "public opinion" "votes" anything American policy life time. There support war middle East quite , Bush, Obama, Trump continued . From I seen thing makes Biden capable Trump says less stupid things, apparently thinks racists good people thing now.The troops go president says American people support troops.> There zero support war Middle East propaganda campaign just started. give couple months, find something will turn tide.Outrage just turns brain offDoes matter? He want people community dying metal object.No. S/hes saying dont give shit regardless, warning, warning, US Iran, worth war. Edit: My mistake. I forgot I literal people think I actually think say words said.If Iran right now let US send drone country? I .> They want pipelines Asia. They also want disrupt Belt Road Initiative.Think bigger picture.The main reason want get away form depending Pakistan ports fact lot ships attacked causing issues Asian supply chain rely heavily Saudi oil imports. A pipeline direct possible Saudi Asia massive boon . It also help lingering threat India Pakistan getting shooting match long running border/ethnic issues. Probably shipping ports first things taken . (Note \*BOTH\* Nuclear weapon capability.)Who said Saudi Arabia needed start fight war benefit turmoil?I'm international relations grad program nearly professors agree statement US overall force peace world, especially fall USSR. In fact, response part US beneficial aspect. Who think set global trade system "new era diplomacy" WWII? The Soviet Union? Even wanted , USSR . The US accounted % world GDP end WWII, overwhelming say set- many post WWII institutions exist day set basis "new era diplomacy". The USSR also closed economy, modern trade system also created large part US.I hope familiar bretton-woods conference. You realize without US ushering , world prosperity today. Free trade, Free protection trade free charge agreed buy shit countries sell post ww get back prosperity. & [ & The personal interest US fight spread communism( rather successfully), lock world global trade manner discourage massive conflicts like happening .I'm pretty liberal, era relative peace ( years) aided fact United States , far, powerful military economy. I'm saying United States especially benevolent, just one clear "top dog" benefits.Global trade protected US, new era diplomacy set led US. An international money system set led US. The US started questionable wars, yes. I'm claiming saintly. But country end incredible global influence, lucky democratic US, rather fascist Nazi Germany, fascist USSR, fascist Communist China... superpowers constant regional great wars. What last country half powerful US, just benevolent? Never history.By means US perfect, made plenty mistakes bad decisions. But major reason world (relatively) stable peaceful following World War . Do think world better place right now US retreated back isolationism following war given free rein USSR dominate geopolitics way US now? Most Western Europe Japan rebuilt following war vast amounts American money.Someone read anything world pre-'sDeterrence ( opposed apeasement) interventionism. That's . It's easy argue worked past years advantage hindsight, I'd go arguing whenever west attempted shift policies specific regions, results disastrous. And I'm entirely pleased results deterrence tool used, either. Defensive posturing, working countries willing cooperate enough ensure peace. Deterrence believable show ability fight back. Also, record, first Iraq war started, armed forces th world. It well equipped trained soviet standards employed doctrine soviets employed conventional conflict west. And reason time assume soviet equipment generation inferior US. They knew chance conventional warfare, west shown interest intervene things escalate, invaded Kuweit nonetheless. And got bitchslapped . The point strategies need used major conflicts start, obvious interventions needed. That means occasionally, interventions will needed less prepared foes, chance consolidate defensive position like Iran N. Korea .Or maybe big wars, shining examples human rights sole superpower... like USSR China! The world better place world police, rather US bullies! /sWhy one ? Can't just try good example peace cooperation? The world needs everSo depressing people like see world black white, reality people, situations, actually able much complex nuanced . US never really particularly isolationist recent times. Its interfering , destroying, nations *** least*** last century , invading, bombing, staging coups, undermining Govts, recruiting training terrorists, always imperial power corporate profits. Never peace, democracy, freedom, human rights, propaganda corporate media floods nation . It always comes back money power leadership "elites"Seriously, sometimes reading comments realize uninformed people strongly react simply reading title becoming foreign policy experts.You mean US alleged Iran attacked allied oil tankers. Big difference.If iran ** attack tankers response sanctions us put place trashed diplomatic agreement literally reasonPHEW, thank goodness I afraid since america will getting oil next years reinvade .How Iran clue many people ?So "" board? I know aircraft even used .The villain reddit painting US. Stop looking international events good vs evil. Itâ€™s chess match. The thing advantages disadvantages, winners losers. You dont call opponent villain take one pieces vice versa checkmate . The important thing sides moving pieces. Iran perfectly fine defend borders US perfectly fine wanna .Costs us $M worth $M.> The fact oil tanker explosion blamed Iran. Thatâ€™s Iran . Even top Democrats Germany agree. And anyways, none means Americans will unwillingly sent war. I agree, war Iran horrible, itâ€™s going happen, even , conscription, â€œmy *children* will sent *war*â€ folks give screeching rest.We start war unless protect citizens borders, period. Drones spying countries keep us safe, just like soldiers ground Middle East either. It's arguable Iran attacked oil tankers. The proof US claims grainy video. Japan, one ships attacked [said doubt US narrative]( And Germany requested [proof whether Iran responsible]( rhetoric Trump saying tweeting Iran, think beating drums war?Iran trying start war? You must kidding right? US regime change plans decades excluding Obamas era lol. Remember US Navy downed Iranian passenger plane Iranian airspace killed innocent people.... Remember Saddam US greenlight US supplied Chemical weapons gassed Iranian kurds? God damn evil Iranians trying start wars shit! Sanctions ratshit btw. Iran prior Obama already heavy sanctions DECADES. If wasnt Trump West-Iranian relations improving rapidly instead brink war piece junk may may entered territory.I think will get many people sharing opinion human life worth less inanimate blob metal circuit boards, especially produce boat load necessaryNot really, .. global superpower can nuke planet three times . Quite different Iran...You're ignoring context. This random drone Ecuador cruising casually near Canada. Imagine Superpower country like say "Second-United States," convinced us stop building nuke defend , elected idiot backed nuclear agreement us reason. That idiot finds nonsense impossible prove claims justify parking carrier group coast New York. And country started flying drones airspace test far get scout military targets possible invasion. All , arch nemesis, Russians, buying favor "Second-US" idiot President, enough get ignore Russian leader direct ordering Bill Browder bonesawed random embassy get stuff us, just fight America instead Russians .Maybe shitty drone evade detection well Russian sub, smear wreckage bottom straight.Factually incorrect. They receive warning USAF immediately time enter US airspace turn around / escorted US airspace. Russia last years test response times USAF In fact even express mission old Russian TU-'s last years. Why Russians plane expressly tests long takes told leave US airspace said true?Because youâ€™re taking Trump Boltonâ€™s word reliable? Gimme breakHow know didnâ€™t? It well may .Because manned, just drone.You mean US nuclear missiles forms nuclear subs parked next Iran 'll hit Tehran mins? It's fucking ballpark.I mean true.It's... global hawk. It spying.

The fact Bolton jerks every night thinking blowing middle eastern people help matters either.No, siding party want war instead party literrally faked evidence start war neighbouring country Iran commited countless warcrimes said war. An unstable maniac like Trump just final nail coffin. And talking atrocities, mind I remind concentration camps? Clear porch running mouth somebody elses.And forget Gulf Tonkin.I talking Iran, Iraq try stay topic. What US "crying wolf" ? Did Iran shoot US drone? Did Iran get caught removing one mines Kokuka Courageous? If take Iran face value much sucker anyone else.You believe military rejecting orders Trump? What fucking sources ? Goddamn, better Alex Jones crowd. Ffs, I feel like day people slip blind partisan divide feel emboldened .It support . Addressed people will read discard reasons bias emotion.

To point decided people fake, rather realize fucked Trump gotten . War Iran backing deal game . Biden will run away issue alone.So think Iran paying people recite party line?Iran way less trustworthy US.This /r/conspiracy okay.That kind rhetoric flawed can used justify just everything. For example: drone shot provokes , maybe fly spy drone towards another nations airspace. just retort forcefully enter said neighbours home shoot dead, huh?>toy We talking military spy drone. Have seen side ?Didnâ€™t UN rule Israel allowed hijack flotilla even though still international waters?Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight, cool Iranian jets flying just coast Florida?Stating US government history lying justify military action "Iran causes turmoil" justification declare war putting words mouth. You're one used "creating turmoil" reason trust Iranian government. I think US stirring shit Iran literally incentive attack oil tanker proceed attack drones outside airspace. Why risk military response largest military world? The US, however, massive incentive .Haha even know taking .I'm sure people uniforms last administration itching war peddling misinformation regarding WMDs Iraq...Germany.> No one except top giving orders can really know sure, first time done something like . Been Military years, "drone" field well. To say purposely flew Iranian airspace imply many low, medium, high ranking American Soldiers complicit stay silent obvious violation international law, essentially knowing (since read news ) lead war. That just ridiculous, . The information collection investigation something like takes lots time, deals classified materials. The radar information available, will released eventually. Hell, Iran may even release another DRAWING US violating airspace. Let's forget, oil tankers past month attacked. Whether anyone agrees US foreign policy completely different topic. The fact lawful US fly waters conduct watch shipping lanes.I hope believe ... Haha uninformed.I see people US donâ€™t want war. Its Trump goonies want war. Trump pushing war hard can thinks will boost ratings get reelected rally around leader mentality warThe U.S one pushing conflict Iran one accused blowing tanker, supposedly evidence, now self admitted blowing drone thought international waters one largest trade routes world. I wonder German British drone sentiment ? This shouldnâ€™t mean war, mean need choke even sanctions. And maybe European aircraft get downed â€œaccidentallyâ€ Iran, will buy blockade.Where live?

The ratified treaty follow . They're equal.>Well maybe US needs learn cake eat . When hegemonic geopolitical world superpower, can, indeed.Trump hear interpret : (He can) Have cake eat two (slices cake).Meh, kinda happens. It's just Iran , Russia regularly tests Nato reaction times flying nuclear capable bombers just right outside borders. They [spy ships]( & The difference going better part e century now. Hence routine likely escalate anymore.No nation hostile US navy capable . Only Russia can get bombers close.I mean, want Article invocation see actual support...Iran one get arbitrarily decide going abide international standard.The dispute South China Sea involves China claiming territory beyond internationally recognized. The U.S. always stays outside internationally recognized limits Chinese territory.It really , urbanfirestrike implying Iran United States non-compliance case.Incorrect .

Take Iranian propaganda fuck . My parents escaped shithole uninformed ass spouting mullahâ€™s party line.As one man said, warnings civilian military channels went entirely unanswered.I donâ€™t theory latest attacks. Iran historically threatened outright attacked ships international waters claimed territory. Iâ€™m sure can find incidents google.My links confirm Iran claims ownership Strait Hormuz, simply twelve nautical miles . If acknowledged twelve nm limit legal right block access strait, [yet Iran repeatedly claimed right]( [ periodically attacked tankers traveling strait three decades]( including [four ships attacked May th just coast United Arab Emirates]( obviously far beyond nm zone Iran.> The Iranian navy saying posess power defend, blockade, embargo whatever strait, mean borders dispute. Claiming "control" strait asserting ability blockade embargo fundamentally repudiation notion Iran's rights extend nautical miles. Iran made clear consider sphere control well beyond mark, entirety strait. Again, I never seen one source indicating Iran ever acceded boundary, one demonstrating please share .So still just saying random shit providing sources.Where see ? You're coming needlessly crass.It's Reddit. The thing people love blame United States Electronic Arts.Your phrasing incorrect. Japanese officials stated * convinced Iran,* suggested believe Iran innocent. Basically, just want evidence reach conclusion, perfectly reasonable.Who I think better technology capabilities detect , technologically advanced military - years, world leader technology engineering (Germany) ..... Japan. Yeah.Angela Merkel represents German government, mine.[deleted]Precisely Iran want sink ship. Iran attacking tankers decades pretty good .They can hell lot blow ships wanted . It meant sent message, apparently didnâ€™t come across.Yeah, except explosions happened likely see projectile even looking one. There also two holes ship literally vessel [ pulled limpet mine ]( turns know jackshit happened ship.> There zero evidence done anyone. Except mines, Iranians made effort recover unexploded mine.[deleted]How Iranian sailors removing mine? If wasnâ€™t mine, wouldnâ€™t touched . Thatâ€™s one behaves towards unknown explosive ordnance.And explosions happened side facing UAE, absolutely bone pick Iran.Limpet mines can placed waterline intention behind immobilize ships, sink . Also, side facing absolutely nothing whatsoever culpability. The suggestion limpet mines placed side facing port quite silly, please research subject making statements "* obvious Iran wasnâ€™t behind .*">The explosions happened side facing away Iran.. Um... Iranian boats able go around ships get side?Actually cumdumpster, $.* barrels money $.* barrels. It's happening Venezuela, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia. In Venezuela Iran, crippling sanctions AND decreased oil margins killing economy.Yeah soon authority figure (like fucking Merkel) says must true. When US newspapers report definitely just American ploy*facepalm*It's equivalent "*I'm touching !*" waving hands front someone's face.What non military vehicle? Like oil tanker?Surveillance clearly attempt spot mischief like recent mine attacks, Iran denies, clearly trying hide action.Yes. Airspace territorial seas . The international community agreed territorial seas based upon Nautical Mile distance nearest point territory (beach low tide). Iran however asserted territorial sea based upon liberal claim, stating body water two point territory (bay gulf) subject , miles begins line connecting two points land. Iranâ€™s PR better US cause Prez isnâ€™t named Trump... done fucked one. Not US South China Sea Strait Hormuz now? Crazy. Good know. I'll adjust maps. The drone also allegedly within nautical miles coast. Of course , lol. Why Iran lie? I mean, provide drawing.Of course real world conditions affect performance, whether SAM ranges car's miles per gallon, missing point. Iran capability engage aircraft well outside territorial waters, contrary TreetNstreet claimed.An RQ good airspeed.. In comparison SA-.U didnâ€™t refute said .Mistakes made everyone. That's point.> Flying aircraft outside Iranian airspace carry zero risk. In case, insideSeems like set . I donâ€™t see evidence, mines standard mean can easily stolen even sold countries. Things like never happened usa respected treaty signed. Now opening anyone wanting war weakened iran ( worst idea century)Keep justifying war mongering government fucking love. Maybe just enjoy people dying bit fucking metal?You sure know lot I know. I think itâ€™s ironic party Benghazi insists I fall line. I think itâ€™s ironic party told worry true perpetrators /, let go unpunished, murder man cold blood year ago fucking embassy, instead invaded two countries, one totally false pretenses made evidence, telling fall line. Fuck falling line, even Iran shot drone I donâ€™t give fuck, thatâ€™s reason start war kill Americans.Stopped reading "I particularly care ". Learn obvious shithead get people listen take seriously.I see now. Yikes, situation.This literally theme song one college spring break trips years ago, one favorite clips (someone always filming, know ) just song blasting cooking breakfast one guy turns, deadpan camera, everyone else stops talking, just mouth ".." sync music. What great trip.Right I agree. I'm saying gain much shoot international airspace just try lie . To sensible explanation fired airspace right border impact occured international waters.It international airspace according UNCLO. Iran country world go rules treaty, insists territory extends beyond miles shore.Especially can make airspace whatever want, regardless international standards.True, US actually airspace (I'm saying ), supposed ? I mean, US allow Iranian drones airspace, right?They never said . Try honest wherever possible, please. This serious stuff.I mean, right. Iran's asshole, situation Trump acting crazy Iran actually looks like good guy pretty good reason.If America trying escalate situation used incident justify limited strike Iran. Instead, nothing.Fly side strait. Why fly close possible? And yes, civilian oil tankers. Not registered US, owned US entity. So US retaliating ?"Don't start shit shit." \- [YoungBloodZ]( Iran take responsibility ? I donâ€™t trust US (Iâ€™m US).The usa stop false flag bombing .Quite opposite. Honestly. In past Iâ€™ve example extreme opposite.Did Iran take responsibility ? Or still trusting proven liars?No. Iâ€™m saying canâ€™t split hairs mile two flying , miles away homeland. Additionally, Iran warned drone multiple times. Even dispute, US flown little cause problems. Intentionally poking powder keg something Iâ€™d prefer country .No reason cross Iranian waters though.Iran isnâ€™t nuclear power. At least, wasnâ€™t. We deal. They abiding terms deal. We pulled . Seems like alone makes nuclear war likely.In word...yes. can play victim internationally encourage enact policies circumstances unacceptable.If war declared US I think Iran use green light attack anyone wanted consider US Allies. So I think forays SA, perhaps sabotage pipelines etc. I think Iran plans control Straights key. It's really way Persian golf.I think understand geography politics region well think . Your simplistic thinking. Your just Big Ol Murrica wants steal little teensy Iran's oil. That just one small nearly unimportant, statement. Do idea much commerce travels Straights Hormuz? It's % crude shipments worldwide. And , much higher now. And non oil commerce, also considerable. If Iran shutdown Straights essentially control flow world's oil starve Western adversaries. Now true need keep open can move oil Iran probably wont anything crazy. But excuse run roughshod use military force international community accept certainly take . Which likely Trump held military retaliation today.He called want kill people drone.Warning pretty standard escalation situations. The attack first strike necessarily, tit tat led even escalating tensions. I'm genuinely curious think geopolitical aims attacking tankers likely done Iran.Bull shit, wipe ability wage war one week wanted , stop us?> He doesnâ€™t get thing like start war unilaterally Have just woken multi decade coma?Trump re-election strategy Nixon.I agree . Which I think idea "Trump wants war" merit. War Iran probably help . But yes, definitely hardliners administration fine war. It's pretty murky. I think, though, mostly Iran US recklessly playing hardball around sanctions nuclear negotiations.Not inside Iranian airspace.> You mean Iran blew civilian oil tankers Based video quality Big Foot sighting?I suggest . I'm suggesting Iran want action taken us internationally condemned. This protects Iran isolating us allies attacks causing Iran's allies Russia China come aid.Iran want start war, want fight US sanctions bankrupting . Look Iranian currency. They fucked right now sell oil valuable thing produce. They trying send message world follows US sanctions oil, will prevent Saudis selling oil . Saudis said will replace Iranian oil production global market. Iran let happen.> insane ramp hostilities Bolton Pompeo. What evidence tanker attacks drone shot due either Bolton Pompeo? That rhetorical question none. I'm saying putting pressure ( warhawks) sanctions, one country threatening international shipping shooting drones.>But one ? You just described US. If I describe Iran: >> You trust country run man ~~attacks~~ **jails kills** members press ** refusing hold party line**, claims owe ~~ election~~ ** unelected position** God ~~called ~~ political opponents ~~ ~~ **jailed killed**. That's Iran. The idea Trump somehow worse Ayatollah absurd. It gives admin cover.[removed]Jesus Christ. Iâ€™m fan current administration either try something little creative . This just dumbass conservative npc insult side.> Yeah country amazingly great right now, isnâ€™t ? That's argument? The US perfect, god beats shit living Iran. >You fucking lunatic running country, might oppressing different people different ways, still oppressive disgusting. And yet, one can gay US killed. And one can publish lurid explicit details president's corruption killed imprisoned. Trump incompetent corrupt. Iran morality police. You can disappeared protesting, removing hijab protest, drinking, partying, saying fuck Allah. >Donâ€™t act like US sort holy country can wrong. I . Pointing Iran shithole thing putting US pedestal. I saying US greatest country Earth. I saying Iran shithole murders people love believe. The US problems, nowhere near fucked Iran.Lol thats just another -said--said probably political theatre Germanys part.War games papers Defense think-tanks suggest otherwise. Iran superior military US faced since Korea. How many planes Iran shoot , many aircraft carriers sink Americans say isnâ€™t worth ?This requires believing US narrative one well, Trump deeply hurt credibility without something big totally irrefutable, going hard time convincing great many people.He thoroughly contradicted numerous campaign promises already. His base supporters care . He contradicts weekly. His behavior towards NK immature idiotic possible outside meeting Kim Jong Un throw glass water face slam fists table screaming "NUKE MY COUNTRY!". He made threats "fire fury" Un Twitter. I know examples needed illustrate ignorant interacting hostile foreign power.So true! When Kim told Trump like US/South Korean military exercises, Trump stopped ! And Putin told Trump fuck Syria, Trump ! Such strong leader!war war decision. machine starts & ends wars control, control president. just broadcast news & everyone pretends decision.Agreed. I seen Iran peddle bullshit years. Not afraid call spade spade.Why didnâ€™t answer question?Propaganda much? Lot blame little evidence evidence provided colonialist.There plenty support iraq war. Bush got re-elected.Hard Trump influence policy President anymore.That mean support President. Even years learning game.Too many people already know President liar. His base will support . That base longer large enough get elected. The polls already . Another Middle East war started will finish .Not quite. It's state decision made going changed. You're brain , just focusing implementing instead deciding. If decision "stop war" perfectly correct.Wait, asking. " matter whether sentence read correctly incorrectly?" Just want verify.No thought US warned Iran. That's literally said.Except isnâ€™t US ? The drone loiters ,â€™, donâ€™t need within Iranâ€™s borders conduct long-range surveillance height. The US doesnâ€™t even fly directly Syria reason, Syria never shot one .Yes. Limpet mines possibly touch pipelines. Genius![deleted][deleted]> US overall force peace world That's tough argument make. Rebuilding Europe WWII, helping topple communism, I concede . However, tough time convincing US policy viz Middle East force peace last two decades. We nearly singlehandedly destabilized region. I'm trained historian, usually deal counterfactuals. It's difficult wonder though, things look Iraq happened, instance. There will always winners losers whenever particular policy implemented. The USA exerted soft power great expense others around world. Thoughts?The question asking , professors get grant money?[deleted][deleted]> fascist USSR, fascist Communist China words meanings, know?>What last country half powerful US, just benevolent? Never history. You need read little history seems. Rome, Britain, whenever country powerful enough become superpower wide reach, creates things allow reach solidify. It builds infrastructure can trade powers, protects trade routes makes money trade, largest economy, best position . The reason US put much rebuilding Europe WW specifically otherwise, nations fallen Communism, needed bulwarks Soviet Union trading partners. No one going buy American goods trade America money economy . It's pragmatism, altruism. Also, just quibble, none countries listed fascist. Even Nazi Germany National Socialist, derivative Fascism possesses specific racially ideological component fair bit eugenics interpolated within .

As far I can see, variants allow transport troops. Unless US stuffed soldiers onto plane, forcing stand entire time... Iran said P bullshit.> The thing advantages disadvantages, winners losers.

The winners will military-industrial complex losers will working class countries. There nothing "perfectly fine" .The US perfectly fine trying provoke war Iran can install regime friendly west?The US getting ripped rudimentary drone like costs M. You must joking.They also certain torpedoes. Oops.> Thatâ€™s Iran . Even top Democrats Germany agree. Any explanation Japanese US versions happened Japanese tanker match ? Can think clear reason Japanese lie? I think reasons US want lie.If USA wants war, USA go war? USA wants keep sanctions. Iran wants sanctions end. It survive sanctions. So, Iran trying change situation, trying get US make mistake, get Europe side USA. The US wants regime change. That mean want war. War Iran like war Iraq Vietnam.It's like protecting environment. How many humans worthwhile sacrafice, keep earth viable human life? Probably billions. Because, without healthy environment, NO humans can live. It's similar machines. How many human lives worthwhile sacrafice, protect machines, protect us. Probably near every last human. million people machines protect million dead people. million people adequate machines protect , million people. I'd rather take million alive people, machines, million dead people, without machines.What's different Iran? Having superpower constantly encroach airspace? Or saying Iran ? Because renowned , circling craft directly beside US ships (aircraft otherwise). Or impression US absolutely purpose , international waters, within major trade route tankers attacked?That changes nothing. If afraid idiot maybe try provoke .The option take Iranâ€™s reliable. Not great choice either.I'll take US's word Iran anyday week regardless president> How know didnâ€™t? It well may . How know ? It well may . The onus overwhelmingly person fired missile.

Youâ€™re right, Trump might killing people torturing , heâ€™s selling millions millions dollars weapons country helped / tortured, killed & dismembered American journalist JUST MONTHS AGO.

And coincidentally, Saudi also country will benefit instability war Middle East. ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± Besides, USâ€™s dealbreaker war unmanned drone shot , shouldnâ€™t sent drone first place. They threatening Iran, hoping theyâ€™ll react US can say â€˜ crazy dictatorship started war, us!â€™. That whatâ€™s happening. So , taking account country lose/gain war, I believe Iran.All circumstantial evidence points Iran. Look, I get impulse assume opposite Trump says must true, wise way construct view reality. It's shortcut will lead away truth time time. Look circumstantial evidence .> Iran superior military US faced since Korea. That's saying much, considering -equipped poorly trained DPRK PRC conflict. The advantage conflict manpower compared US, UN, South Korean armies. And even became disadvantage allies began employing -called "meatgrinder" tactics take advantage DPRK/PRC's reliance human-wave tactics general aggression. The US spends military next - world powers combined, standing army / size US's. I think severely -estimating capabilities compared Iran.The UK Germany said Iran responsible attack tankers. Germany, may recall, opposed Iraq war, fond Trump. That's close unbiased confirmation likely get.All true. He's chaotic wild unfocused. This idea masterminding war seems convincing.And still, neither places matters one bit us. It's almost like uses judgement matter. But I guess like see war place? And just claiming war monger looking war? Which ?I've seen US peddle bullshit years. I believe either .What Iran's reason attacking tankers?Because rhetorical.You can lead horse water, make drink...Iraq Yes, one greatest tragedies ever happen America people wanted punish people responsible, generally support ran Bush's presidency plenty big protests.

The masses get excitement investors get profits.I drunk.If main takeaway got I know say. Literally / comment talking starting war drone idiotic. S/ may read US warning saying matter US warned , times implies care damn warning. They want go war drone. *That's* main takeaway.Well, . Iran right shoot drone miles borders, US claims miles away. The reason Syria shoot American drones probably Russia want . After , US able bomb Syrian targets. And yes, drone loiters km altitude, surveillance capabilities severely hampered. For advanced surveillance, effective altitude much lower, surveillance range. And know reason US sent drone either shoot prepare strike, goals indefensible.So post WWII history choosing exclusively focus last two years.

However, fully eliminating Taliban remote areas proven extremely difficult may possible. In Iraq America "won". They outsted Saddam's regime helped set new government controls almost entire country (sans tiny bit, plus Kurdish region autonomy).

It massive impact performance closure rate determines much true distance missile travel, altitude determines much drag missile experiences atmospheric density. If interested, I can dig sources can explain much better I can can read . It's certainly interesting topic.I dont think read comment. He talking targets altitude speed wind. His point totally accurate. If target different altitude heading away site instead towards , drastically changes range.It's wind air ( drag), fact missile always travels constant distance ( fixed altitude). So faster target moving towards missile, overall, less distance missile cover, higher maximum range. On contrary, target flying directly away, missile cover larger distance, maximum range reduced. Altitude another important factor higher altitude less atmospheric drag atmosphere less dense.The UK Germany publicly accused Iran bombing oil tankers. It's pretty clear Iran one trying escalate situation America interested. Also, US park expensive, highly observable drone Iranian airspace? If wanted spy Iran, used stealth drones.

(?)The question implies striking nerve. Which drone .> It's normal, completely different violating airspace. Whether happens routinely, happens.We pretty much talking concept. The missile always capable travelling distance target given target's altitude always flies straight line. In order words, aerodynamic range missile constant ( sometimes described distance missile can cover straight line stalling given altitude, definition depends ask militaries use ). As example, aircraft travelling high speed ( say kt) high altitude ( say k feet) directly towards system, system can fire target km away, target continues fly straight line, will intercept . Then can claim maximum range target closure rate kt k feet km. However, missile covered much less distance , aircraft also flying towards . In example, maximum range far exceeds aerodynamic range missile, can still make . If target, however, flying perpendicular SAM system, distance missile cover much higher, , simple terms, aircraft "helping" cutting distance travel also travelling towards . Therefore target will need closer system missile able reach kinematically. Even worse, target flying _away_ SAM, "helping" cutting distance missile fly, actively making worse _increasing_ distance. Now, aircraft well _within_ missile's aerodynamic range, time missile fired time interception happens, aircraft moved away SAM, distance added distance missile fly. In case, aircraft km away SAM system fired, km away interception happened, missile travel km, travel km. In conditions, maximum range system aerodynamic range missile, even though aircraft km away fired, missile travel . What countries usually producing test like first example, throw "km" number context, reality conditions extremely favorable produce high number, different conditions, number might high. It's pretty much PR number, true aerodynamic range missiles kept confidential. >The intercept vehicle subject atmospheric conditions regardless orientation target. The target's altitude changes drag missile subjected change atmospheric pressure. The higher altitude, lower drag. Also, low altitudes, radars suffer lot ground clutter returns generally leads less favorable results.Yes . If target miles away heading away going supersonic, missile will hit target somewhere miles away launched. So scenario missile needed longer range. Different scenario: target isnt heading away, fire target miles away missile needs range less miles.The Venezuelan government basically split half, half declared invalid.

You can live world think Trump attacked Japanese Norwegian Oil tankers order call missile strike. take strong circumstantial evidence , well US lied past means always liars. That's lazy shortcut always going get truth. Think . Blindly blaming US everything geopolitical analysis.They're closely involved war Yemen, supporting rebels recognized government, course Saudi Arabia involved . Yemen proxy war countries happy destroy order wage proxy war. Iran invited Syria one remaining allies, Assad regime, little legitimacy left. Assad brutal dictator committing atrocities well war. He tortured political prisoners basement dungeons, attempted completely wipe traces Kurdish identity country. Being recognized government says nothing whatsoever morality government, invited kill citizens hardly better US coming Iraq kill Iraq's order remove brutal dictator recognized government. Obviously done , better invited dictator thing. They fund Hezbollah. Perhaps hyperbole say involved every conflict, fair share blood hands master deceivers. My point never Iran worse significant way US. It absurd anyone thread say trust Iran US. There reason whatsoever trust Iran, saying trust US. We really evidence either way regarding drone, tankers appear likely Iran. The motive likely US sanctions plummeted Iranian economy, driving away foreign investors, protests inside country now . In April, US threatened start sanctioning countries buy oil Iran. This might just lead country say, Hey, going stick boot faces, gonna start fighting back. And sort way Iran fights back. Basically, great news hardliners countries. They want conflict. Bolton wants war. The Iranian hardliners want play nicely West. But I just get Trump wants war, refused pull trigger sort escalation, I know gotten away escalation even flying drone Iranian airspace. The idea though, attacked allies tankers order nothing seems rather farfetched. I even remember I'm talking anymore, one talking false flags? Anyway, I'm gonna comment anymore.

Business usual, I gather...Almost half Americans vote ones **almost** / split people preferring Hillary. The facts tell us million people US million voted trump, like % something percent? Fuck outta random ass numbers. & Personally I give flying fuck, country probably give fuck either. Most people country want go day think war country taking part almost certainty want outside extreme circumstances.Yeah talking percent Americans. You said war. Last time I checked percent people speak Americans. You just want . "Lul Murica." Hateraide today.Every country world share crazy people. The U.S. constitution just gives crazy people voice otherwise normally unfortunately. The electoral college key component imbalance.I love I can say Americans want war, go. "Nuh uh." When can agree turns war dumb, pointless. Earlier I spoke America still young country lot learn, opposed allies across sea. We need learn lessons overreaching, greedy, many things hard way. Just like brits, basically every European nation. But really helping. I can say want war I'm blue face, somehow think I'm upholding country regard? I unno whats wrong . Can't just agree war bad, want , just together regard? Rather basically saying. "You're American means suppport everything country percent."That . Opinons change years friend. People consistent. In year period I went depressive, happy. In year period nephew became niece. Either way nobody supported war Iran. Unless stand make money . We can accept sides political system suck, shitty people. And tbh I voted Hillary one two canidates. There ERBH really funny quote.

If youâ€™re going decry Iran action two American allies engage actions ME youâ€™re just hypocrite.No, people taking Iran's side Iran adhered nuclear deal good faith, reason go war . Trump Republicans nuclear deal Obama's . The entire rest world (except two individual US allies Middle East) want go war Iran. During election Trump acted like peace-loving candidate Clinton wanted escalate Syrian War voted favor George W. Bush's war. But now Trump wants war, sudden whole base wants war follow Trump every cliff edge exists.Thank correction. That oversight.That's lie.> US carriers right now. I know just correcting guy, amazingly ridiculous statement. *Only* aircraft carriers. Man, I wish country ðŸ˜¥Luckily, actually Ohio-class subs nuclear capabilities cruise missile capabilities. However, nearing end lifespan working Columbia-class replacements many want least .They retained Cold War-era budget, except Cold War budget even greater point insanity, just compete whatever Soviets thought capable , now assume China capable , I doubt China extreme defense budget US huge one, mainly developing antiquated army materiel country poor backwater state.Cost: $ billion (late 's)[] ($.Â billion dollars[]) Now THAT fucking inflation. The dollar earned worth like cents now.Largest airforce world: US Airforce Second largest: US Navy Ye Ye get 'er done boysAh yes, French one, I forget . I can see America needs ten times many. Gotta keep French surrounded. Who knows might try spreading liberty . True Navy get use features US surplus, patrols, delivers humanitarian aid, fights piracy, however I still feel worth counting amongst surplus due absolutely massive size comparison powers. People used make fun Britain wasting money navy twice size next two powers combined, USA Navy well ratios. Its uses feel like busy work. I know will sound like just armchair admiralty, I wager aircraft carrier fleet cut half still effective America needs. One every ocean sounds like plenty. actually achieve though?That's China Russia. The US military force completely dominant far technology goes. active duty, docked process upgrade/repair ( necessarily mean work). Its just carriers either, part carrier strike group multiple vessels never travel alone, I think many people forget fact. cruiser, - destroyers/frigates, along - aircraft deployed carrier .And saying want wipe Israel map?I mean, ** accident. The US handled incredibly poorly way right situation, given bad intelligence series human errors ship led believe attack. They *know intentionally* fire airliner, just fucked .

If youâ€™re son got hit errant coalition round, thatâ€™s caused war. If son dies dead bodies polluted water supply, thatâ€™s caused war. If son died tractor overturned , thatâ€™s caused war war. A lot stats also tend point blame towards coalition deaths caused insurgents. If bomb goes market, put towards war deaths still say â€œ dead GWOTâ€. Itâ€™s misleading least, core question just â€œare counting deaths caused warâ€.Hes divisive . When close war, question hypocritical demands aggressors?

Yes documentaries, combat footage. But put television every media outlet coast coast, local, national. We learned lesson Vietnam war. If wanna keep masses happy, show shit like . And I much saying publicized definitely hearing outrage. For example Gallagher fuck stick committed war crimes. When went public, people basically chanting die via execution, serve life prison. Combat footage niche group people, select watch requires searched , hunted . Something people bothered , lot documentaries. If news, bother?> closest apocalypse doomsday clock ever . Your source says differently, Jesus Christ even honest insignificant stuff. >But yea Iran much worse tha ...Yea? You realise missiles got fired US embassy Iraq last night? Missiles blamed Iran? >Not going happen. Give war. Find something else bitch . You sure President also aware ?This entire comment nonsense. I will just comment point.

Yemen able import food, water medicine country relies solely aid sufficient support entire population. There's reason majority population starving since Saudi's began blocking access ports. The Saudi coalition [even admitted bombed runway make unusable Iranian plane land deliver aid]( They've also massively delaying aid let [ months causing even unnecessary deaths]( Arabia also [threatened attack aid organisations remained regions controlled Houthis, blatant violation international law protections given aid medical workers war zones]( Saudi Arabia also used cluster bombs, known high risk civilian life Yemen (boy, I wonder peace loving caring Saudi government worried civilian casualties) Want go explaining Saudi's scum?Well itâ€™s gona Israel admitting lol. Letâ€™s say youâ€™re right (youâ€™re ) Israel still funded MEK far longer, youâ€™ve conceded.How nonsense? Because choose ignore behavior? Go ahead live fantasy world supports agenda.
