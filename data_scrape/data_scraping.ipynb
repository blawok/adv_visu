The amount of time it took the US economy to produce the added value for the lost taxes was maybe a few microseconds. We'll survive, it doesn't matter where in the world it was shot down.

Some of us even realize Iran is fairly justified for it's feeling toward the US after British interests got the CIA to through a coup.

      "['An ominous development, and perhaps a sign of things to come.\\n\\nWarhawks take heed: Iran is a global leader in motorized and land-based missile and interdiction technology, detection, and electronic hardening.  They have over 800 third and fourth generation systems with 150km+ ranges already deployed in the field, and that’s just what they’ve advertised.  The terrain of Iran is rugged, sloped, and ideal for deep entrenchment & concealment.  These platforms are highly redundant; their crews are rigorously drilled, trained, and operate at high combat readiness.  Their army is the largest in the ME, by far, and have been preparing operationally and doctrinally to repel a western air assault since the 70s.  Their air forces are negligible, but they don’t need an Air Force to effectively engage one.\\n\\nThis would be not another Shock and Awe campaign for the viewers at home.  Truth be told, it may well go a much different route than most people are likely anticipating.  \\n\\nIran is not just an undefeated regional power in a war torn landscape with a few notches on its belt already - it is a competing global superpower.  They have a broad ability to reach out and touch any aircraft in its airspace or surface vessel in the Gulf of Oman.   Many experts believe they have functional nuclear weapons in their arsenal as well - and if not they would take weeks, not months, to assemble in the face of an existential threat such as the one posed by a broad spectrum aerial campaign undertaken by Israeli and/or US forces. Russia and Turkey would likely support Iran overtly, especially with the US casting itself as the clear aggressor on the world stage. A conflict with Iran would devolve into a slugfest and proxy war of attrition instantly, fed by Turkish and Russian arms.  Even with a total collapse of their supply chain, there are enough heavy arms and munitions stockpiles in Iran for them to fight unassisted for years, if not decades. \\n\\nEven if we could engage in a successful air campaign to substantially impact their industrial and military capacity, any end game plan would undoubtedly include regime change.  This would require a ground invasion on a scale not attempted since Normandy, through mountainous, fortified terrain.  All this - facing an enemy force as large as the Wehrmacht when we landed on Utah, much more well-equipped, supplied, and fighting a single front war with substantial foreign assistance.  We would need to fully commit our regional and reserve strength to have a chance of success in any phase of the campaign.\\n\\nTheir current, non-reserve force strength dwarfs our own in the region, and their mountain divisions are more flexible and well suited, even notwithstanding prepared infrastructure and emplacement.  In the absence of strong allied support, a successful ground campaign would very likely prove logistically impossible within any reasonable timeframe, if at all.  \\n\\nIraq and Afghanistan were a cakewalk in comparison to the Herculean task now being openly contemplated.  I strongly suspect it would turn out a lot like Vietnam, but faster.  If Bolton, Pompei, et al seize upon this as a cause for unilateral military action, this administration is stumbling into a game-changing, (??) - tier blunder.', 1561047949.0]\n",

I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.

All of Iran’s air defense system missiles are outranged not only by cruise missiles fired from ships, but air to surface missiles that US aircraft are equipped with.

That's a missile going over **Five Times** the speed of sound, making any and all defences utterly useless. From the article\\n\\n> One concept now being pursued by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency uses a conventional missile launched from air platforms to loft a smaller, hypersonic glider on its journey, even before the missile reaches its apex. The glider then flies unpowered toward its target. The deadly projectile might ricochet downward, nose tilted up, on layers of atmosphere — the mesosphere, then the stratosphere and troposphere — like an oblate stone on water, in smaller and shallower skips, or it might be directed to pass smoothly through these layers. In either instance, the friction of the lower atmosphere would finally slow it enough to allow a steering system to maneuver it precisely toward its target. The weapon, known as Tactical Boost Glide, is scheduled to be dropped from military planes during testing next year.....\\n\\n> The unusual trajectories of these missiles would allow them to approach their targets at roughly 12 to 50 miles above the earth’s surface. That’s below the altitude at which ballistic missile interceptors — such as the costly American Aegis ship-based system and the Thaad ground-based system — are now designed to typically operate, yet above the altitude that simpler air defense missiles, like the Patriot system, can reach.\\n\\n> The most recent open-air hypersonic-weapon test was completed by the Army and the Navy in October 2017, using a 36,000-pound missile to launch a glider from a rocky beach on the western shores of Kauai, Hawaii, toward Kwajalein Atoll, 2,300 miles to the southwest. The 9 p.m. flight created a trailing sonic boom over the Pacific, which topped out at an estimated 175 decibels, well above the threshold of causing physical pain.\", 1561071020.0]\n",

How many of those deaths were counted against coalition forces when there was no witness to their deaths and there was evidence coalition forces were never in the same area when those deaths occurred? There were multiple reports refuting claims that Allied forces killed civilians they were accused of killing to cover up either the Iraqi\\'s wrong-doing or by the terrorists hand. It\\'s amusing you completely white wash what really happened in Iraq just because you want to be right. The Iraqi government couldn\\'t keep their government together when the Allied forces were in the country trying to help them move forward. Terrorists were able to seize land because the different parties didn\\'t want to even work or take responsibility of their roles in the government no matter how much effort the Allied forces attempted to assist with money and security. They were lazy and stubborn to take back their country. We live in a world where the majority of nations are not ruled by one person or a hierarchy. We live in a time where it has never been more peaceful than it has in history. We live in a time where people feel more free than it has ever been in any point in history.

It wasn\\'t the most stable part of the world by any means, but pretty much all of the \"constant war\" for most of the 20th century revolved around Israel and its neighbors.  \\n\\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2007/09/200852519252884626.html\\n\\nOne major exception was Iraq\\'s failed invasion of Iran in 1983, in which the US supported it (and turned a blind eye to its use of chemical weapons, by the way) and the Iraqi attempt at invading Kuwait (which was delt with in a laudable fashion).\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_chemical_attacks_against_Iran\\n\\nLike him or loath him, Saddam and the Iraqis played a pivotal role in relative regional stability because of the delicate balance of power, particularly between KSA and Iran.  That doesn\\'t mean they were a rosey group, but we tolerate an equal amount of barbarism in KSA than ever existed in Baathist Iraq.  \\n\\nIn the wake of of the 2003 invasion, a huge power vacuum opened up, sparking off the proxy wars of KSA, Turkey, and Iran\\'s regional bid for hegemony, ISIS, the Syrian civil war, etc.  The region has been at a nadir since that invasion, largely **because** of it.\\n\\n>The Causes Belli for the war was \"Sadam Hussein did not provide enough credible information for us to believe he has no WMD\". You either believe he did or he did not.\\n\\nA full scale invasion and occupation of choice based more or less on a hunch should raise a lot more red flags, especially from a non-emotional policy and geopolitical standpoint, than you seem willing to allow for.\\n\\n>I am sure some people wanted this war for selfish reasons, but i believe most people, Bush included, were doing what they thought was right.\\n\\nThat\\'s because it was marketed very well by the former to persuade the latter.  How have we not learned from that experience to be far more skeptical?\\n\\nBecause of more good and deceptive marketing.\\n\\n>What about this is supposed to bother me? That they couldn\\'t read minds or see the future? That is life. It\\'s unfortunate that it happened and i wish i could have done something about it, but i can\\'t.\\n\\nWell, you\\'re spending a lot of time today defending it, even knowing what we know today.  Considering the immense amount of damage to the US, the region, and millions of people, I think it deserves a little deeper analysis than \"that is life.\"  \\n\\n>That is probably because there is A LOT of familiarity between Iraq in 2003 and Iran now.\\n\\nIn how they were/are being marketed.\\n\\n>2 dictatorial countries that are refusing to co-operate with various international agencies and are pursing the construction of weapons that have potential to do massive damage around the world.\\n\\nThe invasion of Iraq was considered and planned long before there was an actual casus belli.  That was created in the buildup to sell it to the public.  We are seeing that again today, starting from day 1 of this administration\\'s rule when they tore up the diplomatic achievement of the previous administration and banned all travel from that part of the world.\\n\\n>It\\'s also important to note that Iran has publicly stated that they are building nuclear plants and refuse for international agencies to properly investigate them. \\n\\nThere was an intricately negotiated treaty to deal with this that the current administration (proudly) tore up.  It is difficult to take this point seriously, as it is an entirely manufactured problem, and an important step in preparing a country\\'s population to buy into another war of choice.\\n\\nHaving a fussy dictator is not a casus belli.  Defying international treaties, when one has been shut out of them for decades, is not a casus belli.  Possessing WMDs is not a causus belli; many countries have them now, and most we tolerate without worry.  We are actively helping give the Saudis, who fit your description perfectly \"dictatorial country who refuses to co-operate with various international agencies and are pursuing the construction of weapons that have the potential to do massive damage around the world.\"  \\n\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-nuclear/us-approved-secret-nuclear-power-work-for-saudi-arabia-idUSKCN1R82MG\\n\\nI need an objective geopolitical reason that spending immense amount of resources on the destruction of a country is in my country\\'s best interests, and so far in both the case of Iraq and now Iran, the argument is nothing more than theoretical fear mongering.  \"If we don\\'t get em first, they might kill us all for no real definable reason other than that they \"hate our freedoms\" or whatever.\"\\n\\nI need better than that, and so should you.', 1561087025.0]\n",

Almost all of the weapons we found were archaic and in very bad shape but they were still able to be used to cause harm. Most of the Chemical weapons we found were still in great shape and could have been used against us during the 2003 operations but weren't. We also still had reports of the Tigris River being polluted from all the chemicals the Government dumped into the river before the US came into the city and not to even touch the water because of how bad it was.\\n\\nThere definitely WMDs because I saw them with my own eyes and the bunkers they were stored in. But the amount people wanted to see and how they wanted to see them (people must think they’re just sitting in a warehouse nice and clean like a movie) would be impossible because Saddam moved stockpiles somewhere else.

They have over 800 third and fourth generation systems with 150km+ ranges already deployed in the field, and that’s just what they’ve advertised.  The terrain of Iran is rugged, sloped, and ideal for deep entrenchment & concealment.  These platforms are highly redundant; their crews are rigorously drilled, trained, and operate at high combat readiness.  Their army is the largest in the ME, by far, and have been preparing operationally and doctrinally to repel a western air assault since the 70s.  Their air forces are negligible, but they don’t need an Air Force to effectively engage one.\\n\\nThis would be not another Shock and Awe campaign for the viewers at home.  Truth be told, it may well go a much different route than most people are likely anticipating.  \\n\\nIran is not just an undefeated regional power in a war torn landscape with a few notches on its belt already - it is a competing global superpower.  They have a broad ability to reach out and touch any aircraft in its airspace or surface vessel in the Gulf of Oman.   Many experts believe they have functional nuclear weapons in their arsenal as well - and if not they would take weeks, not months, to assemble in the face of an existential threat such as the one posed by a broad spectrum aerial campaign undertaken by Israeli and/or US forces. Russia and Turkey would likely support Iran overtly, especially with the US casting itself as the clear aggressor on the world stage. A conflict with Iran would devolve into a slugfest and proxy war of attrition instantly, fed by Turkish and Russian arms.  Even with a total collapse of their supply chain, there are enough heavy arms and munitions stockpiles in Iran for them to fight unassisted for years, if not decades. \\n\\nEven if we could engage in a successful air campaign to substantially impact their industrial and military capacity, any end game plan would undoubtedly include regime change.  This would require a ground invasion on a scale not attempted since Normandy, through mountainous, fortified terrain.  All this - facing an enemy force as large as the Wehrmacht when we landed on Utah, much more well-equipped, supplied, and fighting a single front war with substantial foreign assistance.  We would need to fully commit our regional and reserve strength to have a chance of success in any phase of the campaign.\\n\\nTheir current, non-reserve force strength dwarfs our own in the region, and their mountain divisions are more flexible and well suited, even notwithstanding prepared infrastructure and emplacement.  In the absence of strong allied support, a successful ground campaign would very likely prove logistically impossible within any reasonable timeframe, if at all.  \\n\\nIraq and Afghanistan were a cakewalk in comparison to the Herculean task now being openly contemplated.

From the article\\n\\n> One concept now being pursued by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency uses a conventional missile launched from air platforms to loft a smaller, hypersonic glider on its journey, even before the missile reaches its apex. The glider then flies unpowered toward its target. The deadly projectile might ricochet downward, nose tilted up, on layers of atmosphere — the mesosphere, then the stratosphere and troposphere — like an oblate stone on water, in smaller and shallower skips, or it might be directed to pass smoothly through these layers. In either instance, the friction of the lower atmosphere would finally slow it enough to allow a steering system to maneuver it precisely toward its target. The weapon, known as Tactical Boost Glide, is scheduled to be dropped from military planes during testing next year.....\\n\\n> The unusual trajectories of these missiles would allow them to approach their targets at roughly 12 to 50 miles above the earth’s surface. That’s below the altitude at which ballistic missile interceptors — such as the costly American Aegis ship-based system and the Thaad ground-based system — are now designed to typically operate, yet above the altitude that simpler air defense missiles, like the Patriot system, can reach.\\n\\n> The most recent open-air hypersonic-weapon test was completed by the Army and the Navy in October 2017, using a 36,000-pound missile to launch a glider from a rocky beach on the western shores of Kauai, Hawaii, toward Kwajalein Atoll, 2,300 miles to the southwest.

Constant war, genocide, etc. \\n\\nHardly.  It wasn\\'t the most stable part of the world by any means, but pretty much all of the \"constant war\" for most of the 20th century revolved around Israel and its neighbors.  \\n\\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2007/09/200852519252884626.html\\n\\nOne major exception was Iraq\\'s failed invasion of Iran in 1983, in which the US supported it (and turned a blind eye to its use of chemical weapons, by the way) and the Iraqi attempt at invading Kuwait (which was delt with in a laudable fashion).\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_chemical_attacks_against_Iran\\n\\nLike him or loath him, Saddam and the Iraqis played a pivotal role in relative regional stability because of the delicate balance of power, particularly between KSA and Iran.  That doesn\\'t mean they were a rosey group, but we tolerate an equal amount of barbarism in KSA than ever existed in Baathist Iraq.  \\n\\nIn the wake of of the 2003 invasion, a huge power vacuum opened up, sparking off the proxy wars of KSA, Turkey, and Iran\\'s regional bid for hegemony, ISIS, the Syrian civil war, etc.  The region has been at a nadir since that invasion, largely **because** of it.\\n\\n>The Causes Belli for the war was \"Sadam Hussein did not provide enough credible information for us to believe he has no WMD\". You either believe he did or he did not.\\n\\nA full scale invasion and occupation of choice based more or less on a hunch should raise a lot more red flags, especially from a non-emotional policy and geopolitical standpoint, than you seem willing to allow for.\\n\\n>I am sure some people wanted this war for selfish reasons, but i believe most people, Bush included, were doing what they thought was right.\\n\\nThat\\'s because it was marketed very well by the former to persuade the latter.  How have we not learned from that experience to be far more skeptical?\\n\\nBecause of more good and deceptive marketing.\\n\\n>What about this is supposed to bother me? That they couldn\\'t read minds or see the future? That is life. It\\'s unfortunate that it happened and i wish i could have done something about it, but i can\\'t.\\n\\nWell, you\\'re spending a lot of time today defending it, even knowing what we know today.  Considering the immense amount of damage to the US, the region, and millions of people, I think it deserves a little deeper analysis than \"that is life.\"  \\n\\n>That is probably because there is A LOT of familiarity between Iraq in 2003 and Iran now.\\n\\nIn how they were/are being marketed.\\n\\n>2 dictatorial countries that are refusing to co-operate with various international agencies and are pursing the construction of weapons that have potential to do massive damage around the world.\\n\\nThe invasion of Iraq was considered and planned long before there was an actual casus belli.  That was created in the buildup to sell it to the public.  We are seeing that again today, starting from day 1 of this administration\\'s rule when they tore up the diplomatic achievement of the previous administration and banned all travel from that part of the world.\\n\\n>It\\'s also important to note that Iran has publicly stated that they are building nuclear plants and refuse for international agencies to properly investigate them. \\n\\nThere was an intricately negotiated treaty to deal with this that the current administration (proudly) tore up.  It is difficult to take this point seriously, as it is an entirely manufactured problem, and an important step in preparing a country\\'s population to buy into another war of choice.\\n\\nHaving a fussy dictator is not a casus belli.  Defying international treaties, when one has been shut out of them for decades, is not a casus belli.  Possessing WMDs is not a causus belli; many countries have them now, and most we tolerate without worry.

Most of the Chemical weapons we found were still in great shape and could have been used against us during the 2003 operations but weren't. We also still had reports of the Tigris River being polluted from all the chemicals the Government dumped into the river before the US came into the city and not to even touch the water because of how bad it was.\\n\\nThere definitely WMDs because I saw them with my own eyes and the bunkers they were stored in. But the amount people wanted to see and how they wanted to see them (people must think they’re just sitting in a warehouse nice and clean like a movie) would be impossible because Saddam moved stockpiles somewhere else.
