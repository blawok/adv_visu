5	1561065986.0	"The drone that was shot down appears to have been a Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) which is the Navy's version of a Global Hawk aircraft. Global Hawk aircraft typically fly at very high altitude, upwards of 65,000 ft. 

A key point from the article: 
>Keep in mind, BAMS-D, like the Global Hawk and the MQ-4C to a degree, has zero penetration mission. It doesn't fly into contested airspace. It is literally a sitting duck. The only reason it would do so would be if it was off the leash or there was a major navigational malfunction. It is far more likely Iran just shot it out of international airspace as the Pentagon states.

31	1561072689.0	"As an American: no US lives lost, let's just move on. As we move more and more to robotic warfare, losses are financial, not humans, so not a big deal. The amount of time it took the US economy to produce the added value for the lost taxes was maybe a few microseconds. We'll survive, it doesn't matter where in the world it was shot down. Any escalation leading to loss of human life over what amounts to a broken toy is stupid. Drones are expendable, hence the name. Troops shooting on troops is a big deal, either side using missiles orndrones to attack targets inside the others border is a big deal. Their explosive drone (ie a missile) colliding with our surveillance drone:not a big deal. 

This  is just a distraction from the fact that more Americans than ever support impeaching the administration or will vote for any other candidate beside Douchbags. Iran has not attacked US service personnel or territory, nor that of our Allies, and such Allies who have received attacks has not pursued escalation. If anything comes of this, it's Drumpf shit stirring for re-election. He pivoted N korea from an aggressive footing to a peacemaking and is attempting to pivot peacemaking to aggression with Iran,  He is just doing the opposite of Obama. Just imagine if Obama had a heart attack and survived, Trump's heart would turn out to be the most patriotic of us all. 

Most Americans really don't care about Iran, unless Iran has particularly belligerent about Israel, which I don't believe they have been, and under the current corruption of its PM, I wouldn't necessarily want to take either side.  Some of us even realize Iran is fairly justified for it's feeling toward the US after British interests got the CIA to through a coup. Iran to my understanding is most opposed to SA as a regional power, and if so okay they can do what they want, just avoid genocide and war crimes. A spike in oil and gas prices will simply fund research and development of competing technologies. I'm in favor of greener technologies, and increased oil prices, though I would prefer war not be the cause."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 01:18:09

35	1561047949.0	"An ominous development, and perhaps a sign of things to come.

Warhawks take heed: Iran is a global leader in motorized and land-based missile and interdiction technology, detection, and electronic hardening.  They have over 800 third and fourth generation systems with 150km+ ranges already deployed in the field, and that’s just what they’ve advertised.  The terrain of Iran is rugged, sloped, and ideal for deep entrenchment & concealment.  These platforms are highly redundant; their crews are rigorously drilled, trained, and operate at high combat readiness.  Their army is the largest in the ME, by far, and have been preparing operationally and doctrinally to repel a western air assault since the 70s.  Their air forces are negligible, but they don’t need an Air Force to effectively engage one.

This would be not another Shock and Awe campaign for the viewers at home.  Truth be told, it may well go a much different route than most people are likely anticipating.  

Iran is not just an undefeated regional power in a war torn landscape with a few notches on its belt already - it is a competing global superpower.  They have a broad ability to reach out and touch any aircraft in its airspace or surface vessel in the Gulf of Oman.   Many experts believe they have functional nuclear weapons in their arsenal as well - and if not they would take weeks, not months, to assemble in the face of an existential threat such as the one posed by a broad spectrum aerial campaign undertaken by Israeli and/or US forces. Russia and Turkey would likely support Iran overtly, especially with the US casting itself as the clear aggressor on the world stage. A conflict with Iran would devolve into a slugfest and proxy war of attrition instantly, fed by Turkish and Russian arms.  Even with a total collapse of their supply chain, there are enough heavy arms and munitions stockpiles in Iran for them to fight unassisted for years, if not decades. 

Even if we could engage in a successful air campaign to substantially impact their industrial and military capacity, any end game plan would undoubtedly include regime change.  This would require a ground invasion on a scale not attempted since Normandy, through mountainous, fortified terrain.  All this - facing an enemy force as large as the Wehrmacht when we landed on Utah, much more well-equipped, supplied, and fighting a single front war with substantial foreign assistance.  We would need to fully commit our regional and reserve strength to have a chance of success in any phase of the campaign.

Their current, non-reserve force strength dwarfs our own in the region, and their mountain divisions are more flexible and well suited, even notwithstanding prepared infrastructure and emplacement.  In the absence of strong allied support, a successful ground campaign would very likely prove logistically impossible within any reasonable timeframe, if at all.  

Iraq and Afghanistan were a cakewalk in comparison to the Herculean task now being openly contemplated.  I strongly suspect it would turn out a lot like Vietnam, but faster.  If Bolton, Pompei, et al seize upon this as a cause for unilateral military action, this administration is stumbling into a game-changing, (??) - tier blunder."	c2spc2	2019-06-20 18:25:49

There is an obvious conflict of interest ( assuming the reader wants unbiased info,) if the news is produced by a country involved in the incident. Whether Iranian or American news agencies or allies of either country, this is propaganda. 

In the US we read an Iranian missile shot down a US drone. In Iran we read US drone shot down in Iranian air space. The news article says it’s an Iranian missile and a US drone, but doesn’t say where it was shot down ? Both sides can make a case for war based on this information however, the truth depends on where the line is drawn. I suppose that is difficult when the lines are drawn in sand. 

My point is everyone is so quick to war, despite false pretense ( no independent international investigation conclusion) and regardless of outcome (WW3.)

Let’s fight because we are right and they are wrong, both sides would argue. The failure is that if we enter a nuclear war there are no rights or wrongs, only losses and significant ones at that."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 16:20:33

Why you ask ? simple, the goal is to show Gulf states dependent on oil exports and the nations dependent on imports that 'unknown entities' can threaten tanker traffic. and It isn't the first time they've made such threats.. ""if we can't export oil, no one would""...

Given the deterioration of Iran's economy under sanctions (the EU is proving to be of limited value in circumventing the sanctions), instead forcing the crisis to a head is the wisest move. 

They may be expecting greater concessions and more effective mediation from the EU and Russia if war looks likely. Mining the straits of Hormuz is disruptive, deniable, cheap and hard to counter. By minimizing civilian losses and restricting the conflict in space they are able to avoid inflaming global public opinion. 

They are provoking war via their proxies but in a way that makes it difficult for the US to actually go to war. They calculate this will be mean angry rhetoric and alarming shows of force accompanied by a diplomatic scramble that ultimately will offer more concessions than the present situation. Doubtless they are also keen to be seen by their own domestic constituencies as negotiating from a position of strength."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 04:40:17

The US (and the Western bloc) lost the Syrian War against Russia and the Eastern bloc, changing the balance of power in the world.  Iran can conceivably win the war with Russia and China providing funds, weaponry, soldiers, and propaganda to the cause of Iran.  If Iran wins the war, then that means that the global balance of power will further shift significantly towards China and Russia, which will greatly benefit Iran since they are political and economic allies.  The US and the Western bloc has sanctions against Iran.  If Iran wins, then with the new global balance of power, these will be a lot less effective, meaning that Iran will experience an economic boom.  The Eastern bloc is likely counting on that if the US loses the war, then the global balance of power will shift significantly towards the East, ending Western dominance of the world.	c2spc2	2019-06-21 08:35:33

Iran is also calculating ─ quite correctly IMO ─, that US isn't going to go to major war over something petty like this. Retaliation below a major war will massively bolster the Iran's government against internal threats, since the country will rally against the external threat. It'll also give Iran diplomatic ammunition to fight against current and additional sanctions, which are crushing them and about to get worse.

Always keep in mind, that destruction of property and loss of life is not usually itself important on a national scale. They're easy to replace to a reasonable extent. What is important is staying in power through any means. Economic collapse because of sanctions is a potential existential threat to Iran's government, while a limited US attack is mostly a positive. Any damage such a strike would do is easy to recover from and provides a propaganda boost, that will quiet down the internal rumblings currently going on in Iran."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 03:25:23

The only reason it would do so would be if it was off the leash or there was a major navigational malfunction. It is far more likely Iran just shot it out of international airspace as the Pentagon states.

Spoofing a satellite or manufacturing evidence is easy either way. Military GPS is separate, it's publicly known that it's signal is encrypted and utilizes authentication to mitigate spoofing risk.

I agree we don't need another war, and I think Iran chose it's response to send a message, but not bring immediate war. Shooting down a drone isn't the same as attacking US soldiers for example.

Shooting at another country's military equipment is understood to be a declaration of war.

Likewise you want to be damn sure about invisible lines in the sky or sea when it comes to defending your sovereignty.  Generally speaking people's approach to this has been to intercept violators or send strongly worded diplomatic dispatches.  You only shoot when you think the other side is violating your territory with intent to attack.

I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

These several dozen impacts would not be sufficient to make a substantial impact on their military or industrial capacity.  Damage would be reparable within weeks, if not days.

As for the comparison to Iraq, Iran is technologically, numerically, and militarily superior in every way.  Also, Iraq is flat, ethnically divided, and their military was unmotivated and devoid of vetting, supplies, discipline, and morale - and we are still fighting there.  Iran suffers none of these problems.

Also, our manned aircraft cost tens - hundreds of millions of dollars a piece, plus the million+ dollar value of the life and training of the now-KIA pilot.  This drone itself was a multimillion dollar piece of equipment.  A missile costs 15 grand in American money.  What you’re describing is the textbook definition of a losing attritional campaign.

They conquered over half of it - overran us firebases, laid siege to the city hospital, and killed Army MAJ Horst Moore and a few captains in the process.  

What happened in the following weeks destroyed that city too.  The population of Mosul shrank from more than a million to a several thousand.  By the end of 2004, [edit: many thresholds; see comment chain] in the city core had a Punisher skull spraypainted on it as a house clearing gift courtesy of US Army patrols.

That is done by tens of thousands of professionals in the Intelligence Communitu and they don't have a problem disagreeing with Trump. Like when he said there was no Russian interference in our elections and the IC said there absolutely was. Or yesterday when Tump said the shootdown was an accident and the IC said it certainly was not. People give Trump too much credit and influence over a very divisive and diverse government. Ever since the Bush administration made the IC find proof of ""WMDs"" in Iraq and the IC got thrown under the bus when they didn't exist the IC no longer just nods and agrees with the White House they make their own declarations when they can reveal their intel. 

Also the crew of the tankers in *no* way said they didn't think it was Iran they said it wasn't a mine but a projectile but video evidence shows mines being removed from the ship, there's a left over magnet, fingerprints and exploded fragments from the mines that look like one Oran showed off in a parade. The boat removing the mine looked similar to ones the IRGC navy has and was last seen heading towards Iran. What's thrown into doubt is that Iran is the only possible culprit and an independent investigation has been called for which is fair since Trump cannot be trusted. But forensics will likely lead back to a mine and could be traced to Iran if they did it. Also both the UK and Australia independently confirmed the U.S. claim with their own Intel and they don't have a problem disagreeing with Trump. Any Middle East expert will tell you that when it comes to attacks in the ME, if it looks like Iran, if it smells like Iran...it might be Iran. They've sponsored terrorist groups in Lebabon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen to name a few and the 911 commission found they actually unknowingly gave protection and transportation the the twin tower attackers. That's not the same as directing or planning but that's how involved they've been in some sophisticated attacks. Missiles and rockets produced by Iran are often later used by violent extremists later on. Iran has a lot of hands in a lot of things in the ME. It should shock no one if the UN investigation confirms the same thing. And I am not advocating war only telling people to not be naive about Iran's role in the ME.

That was a horrible disaster and it's terrible he wasn't punished for his incompetence and arrogance. The Captain of the ship was claiming he was in international waters but it was demonstrated that was incorrect. But that was also in the 80's and tech has improved a lot and we can more easily prove the location of the aircraft at the time of the shootdown.

The debris landed in Iran.

I'm not an expert in vectors admittedly, but you're going to tell me the wreckage of a drone travelling at 30,000 feet moved 100 miles or more laterally to land in Iran?

My guess is in reality the US was skirting the border of Iranian airspace really damn close, or possibly even going over the line. Iran saw the drone either in their space or believed incorrectly that it was so, and then fired.

Holding these parts aside, let's look at the bigger picture. Do you genuinely think Iran would intentionally provoke the US? They have nothing to gain. Even if the entire global community stepped back from this one, Iran's infrastructure would be ruined and its defenses in shambles. For what? Some would say so that they could go on a holy crusade and sure I'd believe that of the Ayatollah, but not of Rouhani. To say nothing of the majority of Iranian civilians.

Given the deterioration of Iran's economy under sanctions (the EU is proving to be of limited value in circumventing the sanctions), instead forcing the crisis to a head is the wisest move.

They may be expecting greater concessions and more effective mediation from the EU and Russia if war looks likely. Mining the straits of Hormuz is disruptive, deniable, cheap and hard to counter. 

They are provoking war via their proxies but in a way that makes it difficult for the US to actually go to war.

Most of Iran’s air defense system is anti aircraft artillery and rockets, which as was famously shown in the Gulf War are entirely incapable of stopping a modern air attack. All of Iran’s air defense system missiles are outranged not only by cruise missiles fired from ships, but air to surface missiles that US aircraft are equipped with. It’s hard to shoot down a plane with a missile when they’re firing missiles from twice the range of yours. And it’s impossible to knock them out of the sky when they can fly over the max altitude of all your anti air artillery.


Iran doesn’t have as much in the way of anti ship countermeasures outside of littoral waters, which is not where the US Navy keeps their ships. With the amount of guided missile destroyers in the region, and the guided missile stores that we have in nearby allied countries, Iran could be struck well over a hundred times with cruise missiles before the tempo even began to slow.


As for your argument about my comparison to Iraq, once again, that’s exactly what was said about Iraq before the air campaign started. And it’s also just not true. Sure technologically, but Iran holds the advantage there of existing 30 years in the future of what you’re comparing it too.


The rest is completely false. The Iraqi military had 900,000 men, with a fully mobilized strength of almost 2 million. 1/3 of their regular army were combat veterans. Fully mobilized, Iran can field a little less than 900,000 men, almost none of whom are combat veterans.

That's a missile going over **Five Times** the speed of sound, making any and all defences utterly useless. From the article

> One concept now being pursued by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency uses a conventional missile launched from air platforms to loft a smaller, hypersonic glider on its journey, even before the missile reaches its apex. The glider then flies unpowered toward its target. The deadly projectile might ricochet downward, nose tilted up, on layers of atmosphere — the mesosphere, then the stratosphere and troposphere — like an oblate stone on water, in smaller and shallower skips, or it might be directed to pass smoothly through these layers. In either instance, the friction of the lower atmosphere would finally slow it enough to allow a steering system to maneuver it precisely toward its target. The weapon, known as Tactical Boost Glide, is scheduled to be dropped from military planes during testing next year.....

> The unusual trajectories of these missiles would allow them to approach their targets at roughly 12 to 50 miles above the earth’s surface. That’s below the altitude at which ballistic missile interceptors — such as the costly American Aegis ship-based system and the Thaad ground-based system — are now designed to typically operate, yet above the altitude that simpler air defense missiles, like the Patriot system, can reach.

> The most recent open-air hypersonic-weapon test was completed by the Army and the Navy in October 2017, using a 36,000-pound missile to launch a glider from a rocky beach on the western shores of Kauai, Hawaii, toward Kwajalein Atoll, 2,300 miles to the southwest. The 9 p.m. flight created a trailing sonic boom over the Pacific, which topped out at an estimated 175 decibels, well above the threshold of causing physical pain."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 00:50:20

you're just showing me you don't understand how beneficial our involvement in the middle east is, and how much it does for world peace, the American navy polices the oceans, this not only ensures every country keeps American currency on reserve (making us rich and easy to trade with) but also ensures every country in the world DOESN'T need their own navy (reducing arms building and preventing world wars) if we don't police the problem parts of the world.....we lose that nice kushy arrangement that keeps us safe and rich, and other more numerous more trigger happy players don't enter the warspace.

the benefits of going to war with iran therefor are 1. our currency maintains global dominance and consumer confidence in our trade powers remains high 2. the world's nations don't build their own navys as they defer to us. 3. we destroy a sponsor of terrorism, protecting our troops and assets 4. we protect our figure head states in the region thus making it cheaper and more affordable to police the region in the future

The Taliban didn't exist during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and conflating the two just shows how little you know about region.

There's never been a war with Iran, so I have no idea what you're going on about there.

France, the UK, and Russia certainly did fuck over the middle east with the Sykes-Picot agreement. Since we're altering history today, did the US now play a heavy hand in that?

Look, I'm not going to defend the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It was a criminal action at best, and it's a fucking travesty that no one was ever held accountable for it.

>US was skirting the border of Iranian airspace

Which isn't that abnormal a thing to do anyway, because Iran claims their airspace juts out a *lot* farther into the Gulf than the international community recognizes. Furthermore, due to the width of the Gulf, flying anywhere in that channel is flying ""next to"" the border.

But, again, you're missing the point - the aircraft in particular was a Navy bird designed to monitor *ships.* There's absolutely no argument that it had to ""get close"" to Iran in the first place.

>Do you genuinely think Iran would intentionally provoke the US?

If they thought they could get away with it, sure. Their assumption is that, in the degraded global environment, they can take much more outright hostile acts and not provoke a full US smackdown, because they see that the US is struggling with domestic and international support, *and* has to worry about Russia and China. In 1990, an equivalent to this event would have led to war within 48 hours; in 2019, the fact that there's any question that the US will go to war *at all* is fact enough that Iran's strategy isn't completely insane."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 00:21:58

Iran’s anti air capacity includes far more than AA flak - I think the assertion that this manifests the majority of their anti air defense is wildly inaccurate.  Speaking on anti air batteries alone, are you familiar with the Sayyad3 and later iterations?

As for 100+ cruise missiles, I believe that’s a fair staged estimate were we to fully commit most theatre resources.  Do you believe that would be enough to significantly weaken their defensive or industrial capacity?  

To the comparisons in force strength w the Iraqis, your numbers are on point with official estimates, but I strongly believe the Iranians have a much higher potential for initial and continued mobilization.

1533	1561047816.0	"It’s true that threatening a country with war to prevent them developing weapons is probably going to achieve the opposite effect in the long run. That said, flying a drone in international waters off of Iran is not a provocation in the way that shooting one down definitely is.

Also—and this is purely speculation—I doubt many truly believe their nuclear program wasn’t designed for weapons all along. The 2015 agreement was better than what we have now, but it was only a stopgap for something far more effective down the road. That’s all out the window now. Eventually, world powers need to put their foot down regarding nuclear proliferation. It isn’t going to end well."	c2spc2	2019-06-20 18:23:36

The incident flipped would be equivalent to Iran flying a reconnaissance drone 21 miles off the coast of Florida. Heck, since the strait is so thin, the drone could have been even closer, like 15 miles. What would the U.S. do in that situation? You people are so one sided in your view of military provocation.

So, the U.S. can put troops on the border of a country, fly drones 20 miles off the coast of a country, etc. etc.?

But, if any country were to put troops on the border of Mexico, fly drones 20 miles off the coast of Florida, etc. etc. America would flip its shit and attack without hesitation. Do you not see the double standard here? America got mad about Russia putting missiles on Cuba 100 miles away. What do you think would happen if Iran flew a spy drone 20 miles off the coast of any U.S. border state?

Give me a break. The U.S. is clearly playing provocation games to paint Iran in a bad light so we can go in and kill everyone to get their oil and instate a pro American puppet government. It's disgusting and plainly obvious."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 03:34:47

Also interesting that you think Iran, knowing the full capability of the U.S. military, would want to go to war with us. Are you people serious? Who stands to gain with a war with Iran? We all know they won't win. The U.S. then gets to establish a puppet government that is pro America and bends the knee to American interests. We get all the natural resources and oil from Iran.

Consequences being a destabilization of the region and room for an ISIS 2.0 to rise to power again. The pointless deaths of innocent civilians and American soldiers. The list goes on.

Regime change is not America's responsibility. It has not worked in the past, and it will not work here. Any idiots that want to go to war with Iran can go to Iran and fight them yourselves. America is the provoker here, and I will not sit idly by when America decides to bomb the 12 million civilians in Tehran because of a stupid drone getting shot down.

Warmongers disgust me. You sir, disgust me. Iran poses no threat to the U.S. Until I start seeing Iranian jets and military personnel in Mexico, I couldn't give two shits about Iran shooting down a drone.

It was identified as a civilian aircraft by it's transponder. The AEGIS system identified it as a military aircraft. The ship crew went with the later assessment.

> They also could not make contact with the flight over civilian and military frequencies which the plane should have been on

It was contacted 7 times on a military frequency and three times on a civilian frequency. The Iranian flight crew didn't respond, as the transmitted data, <unidentified aircraft>, speed, altitude and positioning was was not matching their plane.

Cmdr David Carlson with the USS sides states, which was also present at the time of the incident, didn't consider the ""F14"" as threat, as the machine was climbing, using the correct transponder, didn't react to radar tracking and was on a plotted civilian flight path. He criticized the victim blaming and the aggressiveness of the USS Vincennes captain.
But ofc this is his personal opinion.

Overall, gathering from all reports, it was a chain of human errors and false decisions based on falsely interpreted data in a high stress situation, while already taking part in another engagement.

If Russia truly does find themselves the victim of such a far-fetched scheme, they need to recognize their diplomatic denials despite facts in the past has created a well-earned reputation. Explanation that demands a substantial departure from rational thought needs a substantial amount of evidence to justify that stance. Instead of clarification Russia has only offered obfuscation.

This means the NKs only have to launch more than 11 icbms. They are estimated to have enough fissile material for around 60 warheads. It's easier for them to build themselves out of the problem then for the US to buy more interceptors which run $75 million a pop. $300 million for 4 of them means $300 million for each additional NK ICBM.

My thinking on the matter makes as much difference to the situation in Afghanistan as does a full blown US invasion i.e. none.

> You think if the US fucks off that would be the end of it?

No but it won't really change much. The Taliban still control more than half the country (more by night) and collect funds by (de-facto taxation really) taking bribes from USG to leave their convoys unharmed. The Taliban can't rule the whole of Afghanistan now and the won't be able to even if the US leaves just like they weren't able to pre 9/11.  

> Terrorists would still being trying to attack the US.

How many of those came from Afghanistan really? All of them were Arabs from countries which the US counts as its allies. I think a better way of combatting terrorism would be to improve domestic security by replacing the security theatre that is currently in place.

> We must support an Afghan government that isn't the Taliban.

Well the last 18 years haven't worked and the Taliban don't really seem to be losing any ground. The problem is the concept of the nation of Afghanistan is stronger in the people in the west rather than the actual inhabitants of Afghanistan. The guy living in Afghanistan just wants to herd his sheep, manage his crops and fuck his wife. He couldn't give a damn who runs the government or not because frankly the government is fucking irrelevant to him. It gives him nothing, nor he to them. There isn't any sense of a national identity nor any economical linkages beyond the village/tribe level to force a need for abstract concepts such as national unity. We've just force-fed the concept of nation states on to them because we liked it and think we are the bestest and the world fucking revolves around us (but really it is just due to our economic interests, dealing with a nation is easier than a group of tribes and villages). 

> We must support an Afghan government that isn't the Taliban. If that means leaving some people over there to advise them and some planes/drones to bomb to Taliban then so be it.

An Afghan government such as that would never form because it is a different culture and a different society with different beliefs and different values. You would literally need a 100 years and trillions of dollars (a mignitude more trillions than the war btw) of investment in education and infrastructure to **maybe** bring the sort of government you want over there but thankfully we have you over here suggesting some more fucking bombs."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 05:03:53

And cmon Russia just threw lives at the German army until they were defeated, they cared little for losses.  Russia suffered enormously at the hands of Stalin.

""ISIS"" itself was founded in 2013 in Syria, but it was certainly a continuation of AQI if that's what you mean.

>As commander in chief, I would also use our armed forces wisely. When we send our men and women into harm's way, I will clearly define the mission, seek out the advice of our military commanders, objectively evaluate intelligence, and ensure that our troops have the resources and the support they need. I will not hesitate to use force, unilaterally if necessary, to protect the American people or our vital interests whenever we are attacked or imminently threatened.  
>  
>We must also consider using military force in circumstances beyond self-defense in order to provide for the common security that underpins global stability -- to support friends, participate in stability and reconstruction operations, or confront mass atrocities. But when we do use force in situations other than self-defense, we should make every effort to garner the clear support and participation of others -- as President George H. W. Bush did when we led the effort to oust Saddam Hussein from Kuwait in 1991.

2047	1561085934.0	You're not getting my point. Why would they need to fly a spy drone over that specific waterway? A waterway that is 21 miles wide and would easily provoke Iran into shooting down? Not to mention the fact that there still is no concrete evidence that Iran did the tanker attacks. And even if they did, it can easily be interpreted as a response to U.S. sanctions and military threats as the tankers attacked did not sink, nobody was killed, and the mines exploded in precise locations to avoid causing a spill or harming anyone.

I don't love or want to move to Iran. I want their borders, people, government, and sovereignty protected as an independent nation. The U.S. moving thousands of troops into the region, upping military threats, and sending spy planes less than 21 miles off the cost of the country is not respecting the borders, people, government, or sovereignty of Iran

And I'm fully aware that they admitted to shooting down the drone. Good. And? I said there are still investigations and no final answers for the tanker ""attacks.""

If it turns out Iran shot it down over international airspace to manufacture an international incident to their benefit then we should sanction the shit out of them and do our usual local military presence ramp up to remind the Iranian gov just how big the US military dick is.

When their later evidence is eventually released, it's harder to trust because they will have had plenty of time to fabricate, and there's no good explanation for why they didn't release good evidence initially.  

Also, let's look at the big picture: Due to the corruption and incompetence of the illegitimately elected and pathologically dishonest President, there's not even a Secretary of Defense in place right now, and his Secretary of State is a known liar, and his top advisors are well known for being massive frauds and complicit in war crimes.  That doesn't exactly inspire confidence.  History also tells us that the USA from top to bottom will lie as they did for more than three years when they murdered 300 civilians after an irresponsibly aggressive Admiral violate Iranian territory and shot down an obvious giant slow moving civilian airliner.

That was majority fronted by people not nationalized in Iran and was able to influence the people better because they controlled things from the outside.

They've had full control of their nation for decades and they consistently show they are incapable of being a peaceful nation. They've supported and funded terrorist activities, they've consistently disrupt peace in the region, and they keep shooting themselves in the foot with their bad choices. The people of Iran are unable to liberate themselves from this oppression and have told other nations that the Ayatollah does not represent them as individuals. The people want to be able to live free and able to make their own choices in life.

And to say we don't care about Iranian people to show how simple minded you are. So you want me to believe you'd rather just leave people to be suppressed and to not be free.

So in your opinion, we intentionally and obviously flew an extremely expensive and valued asset that isn't easily replaced into Iranian airspace, where they then shot it down. Yeah. Sure we did. And I'm sure you think the US bombed those tankers earlier, and hit the Saudis with a cruise missile as well.

Its more likely that Iran is trying to hide evidence of their guilt involving the tankers and shot down the drone because they knew theyd be fucked if they didnt. This way they can still capitalize on their newfound worldwide support and blame the US.

2116	1561112308.0	That's a calculated risk which is different that's not putting an asset in danger just to justify going to war. The same was done with U-2 flights over the USSR before it was shot down. That's a stealth driven they must have assumed was undetectable and the Intel gathered worth the risk. I'm sure they tested several times first. So that's very of different. Every nation takes those risks it just doesn't always pay off. Sacrificing just to start a war is different and you'd get push back. Also people need to keep in mind. Iran violate the UN law of the sea recognized by every nation and claims almost all of the Persian Golf as their airspace so when it is stated it was shot down in international waters that could be what everyone but Iran recognizes. Iran likes to chear by saying uninhabited islands are theirs to expand territory. Look up INCLOS it explains it. That states that you own 14 nautical miles from your continental shelf or an inhabited island. There's other technical mumbi jimbo but I know they can't ok internationally claim what they do.	c2spc2	2019-06-21 12:18:28

According to the newly declassified NIE, the intelligence community concluded that Iraq ""probably has renovated a [vaccine] production plant"" to manufacture biological weapons ""but we are unable to determine whether [biological weapons] agent research has resumed."" The NIE also said Hussein did not have ""sufficient material"" to manufacture any nuclear weapons and ""the information we have on Iraqi nuclear personnel does not appear consistent with a coherent effort to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program.""


Here's bush after he was given the report:

But in an October 7, 2002 speech in Cincinnati, Ohio, then-President George W. Bush simply said Iraq, ""possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons"" and ""the evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.""

and your retelling of this China situation is interesting.  Because by all accounts it is China that is causing the delays.  They want to appear strong to their people and worry about how the concessions they are making will play out at home.  The big roadblock that led to the increase in tariffs is due to the fact the US wants them to codify into law some of the concessions, while China wants to just make the promises that they will stop some of the practices.

I'm very open to discussion, but you're off on a bonkers tangent that has nothing to do with what I said.

If the USA *NEEDS* to go to war to ensure the safety of Americans and their allies, then so be it, but of course I would hope it never reaches this point, and I think anyone with any bit of education on the matter knows that it will never happen.

Iran does not want war, Iran wants total immunity for everything they do. This has fucked surrounding countries MANY MANY times in history, and now some of those nations are our allies. Anyone with nukes is a superpower... the amount of power you hold when you have nuclear weapons is insane, it puts you at the table with the big boys (Russia, USA, China, and Western Allies).

The USA, its Allies, and the rest of the world do not want war, we want Iran to be held accountable for their actions, and we want to restrict their tyrannical government's power. Iran is a VERY powerful nation, and they're also incredibly unstable, an unstable government who has nukes and simultaneously arms radical extremist militias TO FIGHT INNOCENT PEOPLE is just about the worst case scenario for you, me and literally every single person on this planet.

>Iran has zero motive to go to war with us. Pretty sure the regime isn’t suicidal.

It is not suicidal, but they are willing to risk a LOT, because they have an insane amount to gain from this if they succeed. They either win the lottery with very high chance of success (gaining power), or they lose what they paid for the ticket (trying to gain power).

I doubt you're willing to see the other side of Trump's involvement in this, but I highly encourage you to question why he would pull out besides your assumption that he wants war. The Iran deal was truly awful, it was reached by JCPOA, and negotiations took so long, that it nullified half of its duration. It allowed Iran to continue nuclear weapons research as soon as 2023 with no provision. The deal stipulated Iran could only conduct nuclear energy research in this timeframe (signed - 2022) with provision from Western Allies, and Iran claimed they were already doing this, so they wouldn't change anything... this was proven false by Israeli intelligence, they showed that Iran was conducting nuclear weapons research guised through their 'nuclear energy research' programs. Iran even openly stated that they would break the 'new' Iran deal with the US and its Allies *within days*.

Have you not learned that in history? Or are you just seeing everything about war is negative and nothing more? Let me make it simple for you then. If you saw a women with bruises on her body and looks fearful of her life with her husband that is angry and aggressive to her but when he sees you, he changes to a friendly person and doesn't bring attention to himself that much unless you start to meddle into their life. Knowing that things can go worse for her and possibly you, would you try to help her get away from her abusive husband? Or would you just leave them alone and let the situation get worse? You'd probably call the cops and try to be there for her but her husband knows you're trying to break them apart. And who would the cops be? Would it be just one patrol car, maybe a couple, maybe they know more information about the husband so they bring in a team of police so that the situation wouldn't go south? Would you keep trying to save her from her situation know it could get worse from then? Would you protect yourself from the husband if he came after you? From what you have written here, you would rather let her die by the hands of her husband and just shrug and say ""oh, well. Didn't want to get hurt myself"".

&#x200B;

When you talk about collateral damage, how much of it has already happened? How many LGBT+, women, children, and other people that have been against the government or have been wrongfully accused of crimes because of the Theocratic oppression? Are you not against the government killing people because of their sexual orientation, because a wife was killed because she was accused of adultery with no evidence put forth, a news reporter dug up information on the wrong doings of the government but is thrown in jail or murdered for exposing the truth? That goes with many countries like Saudi Arabia as well. I would support a civil war in SA to create a better, freer nation for the people. How many of those 500K deaths in Iraq were by the hands of their own people or by the terrorists that they didn't bother fighting against? How many of those deaths were counted against coalition forces when there was no witness to their deaths and there was evidence coalition forces were never in the same area when those deaths occurred? There were multiple reports refuting claims that Allied forces killed civilians they were accused of killing to cover up either the Iraqi's wrong-doing or by the terrorists hand. It's amusing you completely white wash what really happened in Iraq just because you want to be right. The Iraqi government couldn't keep their government together when the Allied forces were in the country trying to help them move forward. Terrorists were able to seize land because the different parties didn't want to even work or take responsibility of their roles in the government no matter how much effort the Allied forces attempted to assist with money and security. They were lazy and stubborn to take back their country. We live in a world where the majority of nations are not ruled by one person or a hierarchy. We live in a time where it has never been more peaceful than it has in history. We live in a time where people feel more free than it has ever been in any point in history. And you want to argue dictatorship and oppression is fine? That not everyone should be able to have liberty and make free choice? As long as it's not you that oppressed, right?

&#x200B;

And Iraq is dealing with the consequences of their actions, not ours. We gave them the time and effort to actually try to make things better, they failed to do that in time. The Iraq Government kicked everyone out of important matters, Obama decreased the presence in Iraq because he wanted them to take the lead role in governing matters (he made Iraq more fucked up overall) and created a vacuum because no one in Iraq wanted to take charge and make Iraq into a prosperous nation. They were fine being oppressed and being controlled by a dictator. So the Terrorists took advantage of that. Japan, Germany, multiple examples of Europe and the creation of the EU, multiple Asian countries all have prospered after wars and have become powerful nations in the global market. Why ignore those examples of success? Because it doesn’t fit your narrative? Because it would show that you are not right? War is necessary."	c2spc2	2019-06-22 01:52:09

Speed and maneuverability may not matter much to a hypothetically unseeable aircraft when delivering guided munitions, but do when high-frequency radar is rapidly making any physical stealth capabilities obsolete, at which point it would be a much better idea to retrofit electronic countermeasures into a higher performing aircraft. And I’m referring to the fact that the orginal design goals called for the aircraft to be the primary air superiority and strike fighter secondary only to the F-22 and it has failed to live up to that standard so much that the Navy has placed orders for 78 more F/A-18s to maintain capability and bridge the gap to the results of the Navy’s request for an F/A-XX platform.	c2spc2	2019-06-21 07:28:15

So crew thought it was an airborne weapon... based off sound. I'm not sure how familiar you are with military weapons, I'm personally moderately well educated on them, everything sounds similar, and to someone with zero experience (the japanese crew), there's a zero percent chance they'd know if it was airborne or not just based off sound.

Iran nuking America is not the only bad part of Iran having nukes.

Let's look at the pros FOR Iran if they got nukes today, dismissing the possibility of an attack on American soil:

1. Gigantic leap in firepower, threatening the safety of neighbouring nations, most of whom are US Allies, who have long history of war with Iran. Meaning their political power in the area is ten-fold.

2. Dictating the usage of the Strait of Hormuz (which is an OPENLY STATED GOAL of Iran's). Preventing 1/5th of the world's oil from passing, allowing them to tax or seize it unlawfully, and without much pushback.

3. Huge leap in bargaining at an international level, leveraging destruction as an asset.

4. They'd still pose a threat of mass destruction to Americans, regardless of how small.

Nukes are 99% diplomacy, 1% weapon. In Iran's case, it's more like 80% diplomacy, 20% weapon.

Let me ask you this...

1. Do you think Iran should be allowed to have FULL control the Strait of Hormuz?

2. Should Iran be allowed to bully Western Allies without consequence?

3. After reading the 4 points I made above, do you think Iran having nukes is bad?

One major exception was Iraq's failed invasion of Iran in 1983, in which the US supported it (and turned a blind eye to its use of chemical weapons, by the way) and the Iraqi attempt at invading Kuwait (which was delt with in a laudable fashion).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_chemical_attacks_against_Iran

Like him or loath him, Saddam and the Iraqis played a pivotal role in relative regional stability because of the delicate balance of power, particularly between KSA and Iran.  That doesn't mean they were a rosey group, but we tolerate an equal amount of barbarism in KSA than ever existed in Baathist Iraq.  

In the wake of of the 2003 invasion, a huge power vacuum opened up, sparking off the proxy wars of KSA, Turkey, and Iran's regional bid for hegemony, ISIS, the Syrian civil war, etc.  The region has been at a nadir since that invasion, largely **because** of it.

>The Causes Belli for the war was ""Sadam Hussein did not provide enough credible information for us to believe he has no WMD"". You either believe he did or he did not.

A full scale invasion and occupation of choice based more or less on a hunch should raise a lot more red flags, especially from a non-emotional policy and geopolitical standpoint, than you seem willing to allow for.

>I am sure some people wanted this war for selfish reasons, but i believe most people, Bush included, were doing what they thought was right.

That's because it was marketed very well by the former to persuade the latter.  How have we not learned from that experience to be far more skeptical?

Because of more good and deceptive marketing.

>What about this is supposed to bother me? That they couldn't read minds or see the future? That is life. It's unfortunate that it happened and i wish i could have done something about it, but i can't.

Well, you're spending a lot of time today defending it, even knowing what we know today.  Considering the immense amount of damage to the US, the region, and millions of people, I think it deserves a little deeper analysis than ""that is life.""  

>That is probably because there is A LOT of familiarity between Iraq in 2003 and Iran now.

In how they were/are being marketed.

>2 dictatorial countries that are refusing to co-operate with various international agencies and are pursing the construction of weapons that have potential to do massive damage around the world.

The invasion of Iraq was considered and planned long before there was an actual casus belli.  That was created in the buildup to sell it to the public.  We are seeing that again today, starting from day 1 of this administration's rule when they tore up the diplomatic achievement of the previous administration and banned all travel from that part of the world.

>It's also important to note that Iran has publicly stated that they are building nuclear plants and refuse for international agencies to properly investigate them. 

There was an intricately negotiated treaty to deal with this that the current administration (proudly) tore up.  It is difficult to take this point seriously, as it is an entirely manufactured problem, and an important step in preparing a country's population to buy into another war of choice.

Having a fussy dictator is not a casus belli.  Defying international treaties, when one has been shut out of them for decades, is not a casus belli.  Possessing WMDs is not a causus belli; many countries have them now, and most we tolerate without worry.  We are actively helping give the Saudis, who fit your description perfectly ""dictatorial country who refuses to co-operate with various international agencies and are pursuing the construction of weapons that have the potential to do massive damage around the world.""

I need an objective geopolitical reason that spending immense amount of resources on the destruction of a country is in my country's best interests, and so far in both the case of Iraq and now Iran, the argument is nothing more than theoretical fear mongering.

2573	1561088809.0	"  Let me add my time in service for this also. I was in Iraq serving in 2005. I was part of a team that assisted with demolition of WMDs while there. We dismantled Biological and Chemical weapons that we found buried that Saddam ordered to. Almost all of the weapons we found were archaic and in very bad shape but they were still able to be used to cause harm. Most of the Chemical weapons we found were still in great shape and could have been used against us during the 2003 operations but weren't. We also still had reports of the Tigris River being polluted from all the chemicals the Government dumped into the river before the US came into the city and not to even touch the water because of how bad it was.

There definitely WMDs because I saw them with my own eyes and the bunkers they were stored in. But the amount people wanted to see and how they wanted to see them (people must think they’re just sitting in a warehouse nice and clean like a movie) would be impossible because Saddam moved stockpiles somewhere else. We believe all of the stockpiles he had were shipped to Syria and are now being used against those people. It’s a vicious cycle."	c2spc2	2019-06-21 05:46:49

>A public relations firm working for the kingdom spent nearly $270,000 on lodging and catering at his Washington hotel near the Oval Office through March of last year, according to filings to the Justice Department. 

..

> The newspaper cited an internal letter from the hotel's general manager, who wrote that a ""last-minute"" visit in March by a group from Saudi Arabia accompanying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had boosted room rentals at the hotel by 13 percent for the first three months of the year, after two years of decline.

2.  Short term boost to the economy for 2-4 years.  Republicans and rich pat themselves on the back for a job well done.

4.  War to dominate the headlines, and provide an excuse for a second taxpayer stimulus (this time for the military).  Its too late, however.  
5.  Waste money, lives, and make more enemies.
6.  Market and economic crash.  Poor peep lose homes and retirement, rich buy up real estate at a discount.

Trump will absolutely lose his mind and call his people to arms - come get our guns Betto, or some such tweet. It will have the intended effect. The point is to create chaos. If you read the AMA with the Art of the Deal ghost writer and were semi-concious over the past 2 years it's clear Trump will do anything, any-fucking-thing, to survive. If the Iranians start proving more capable than Trump sees them but that war games have predicted, the US may take significant casualties. At that point does anyone doubt that Trump will do what every right wing loon likes to call for and nuke them back to the stoneage. Except it's not a tired old phrase, it's millions of lives, environmental, political and economic disaster and ignominy for all time. The US will join the ranks of Rome and Nazi Germany in brutality.

Trump and his establishment are doing so many ridiculous (or crooked, stupid, etc) things daily that they aren’t even trying to cover it up or get it out of the headlines. I’ve said this before, but we can’t seriously continue to call the entire administration stupid while simultaneously acting like they’re outmaneuvering the masses. They’re either playing those watching, or they aren’t.

On the same note, blame the fucking 4th estate, who the most consumed majority of turned actual journalism, reporting, and information services into entertainment and outrage due to money hungry powers controlling them. If they wanted to, they could easily cover multiple stories at once or not fall for the cycle bait that they do constantly, but they’re too worried about their livelihood and ad dollars to give a shit. Too busy playing both sides opinion cards and lobby posturing to control narratives, instead of factual reporting and improving the public’s knowledge. 

And don’t say they do care. If they do, they wouldn’t assign bland personalities in coverage, due to a fear of shaking up the boat to much. Same applies to asking those that are part of the problem actual hard hitting questions instead of teeing up meatballs for the crooked to hit at the risk of losing money or access.

I’m sure people will disagree or whatever, but it’s just a single opinion that some agree with and some will consider wrong. Very few involved in politics or covering politics are doing it to provide a public service anymore it feels like though, or to uncover / report the truth as far as the press goes.

Edit: I know this isn’t necessarily about the thread, but just a take on how things seem to be covered. I understand the idea that they’re doing what they’re doing to control more of a control of oil in the way (not necessarily claim the actual oil) from what I can gather, but that doesn’t mean it’s being done in the proper way. The sooner we aren’t so reliant on oil, the less need for this shit there will be, hopefully."	d73dss	2019-09-21 14:00:10

Let's blame Iran for what's going in in Yemen, let's condemn the Huthis who are victims of a Saudi Arabian genocide, and let's send increased weapons and troops to support that genocide and enter into a war that the American people don't want over something the neo-cons have absolutely no proof Iran was involved in, and all evidence points to the Huthi rebels, who are, to put emphasis on this point, ***the victims of a Saudi-led genocide according to the UN,*** in direct violation of the Constitution, as any military action requires the approval of Congress.

And to continue my sarcasm, I'm sure the Congressional Democrats' response to this will be incredibly strong, and Trump will finally be held accountable for taking illegal military action, potentially starting a war the American people don't want, and contributing to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

Now this part isn't sarcastic. When this administration inevitably fails to get a second term, on top of all the other domestic crimes Trump has committed that he needs to be indicted for, he should absolutely be brought to the Hague for this, along with Bolton, Pompeo, and all of his other neo-con warhawks. While we're at it, the Salmans should be brought before the Hague as well. They're the ones committing the genocide and trying desperately to destabilize the region after all."	d73dss	2019-09-24 21:15:59

1) they are expensive, and the Saudis are rich

2) the Saudi leadership still remembers them from Gulf War 1 & 2

3) if you ask someone who doesn’t want to get involved what we have that “shoots down flying things” that’s a good answer


So if the Houthis get their hands on some scud missles, the Saudis are safe! Does anyone know if even point defense weapons like a phalanx can shoot down drones riding the deck? I know these systems have safe zones to, say, prevent the bridge from looking like a target. Drones can move fast and take the worst path for the defenders pretty easily.

If they are smart, we are setting up jamming and directional HERF for them. An intelligent adversary will expect jamming and have the final trajectory preprogrammed. So little ideas like moving around shipping  containers on sight regularly, and arming the guards with shotguns (and having them shoot skeet regularly) aren’t a bad idea.

A proper attempt to cripple Saudi oil production is to take out the de-sulpharization process at Abqaiq, Pump Station One near Abqaiq, the sea oil Loading platform at Ras Tanura, and the Qatif Junction near Ras Tanura. 

If the sulphur towers are gone at Abqaiq, production will be down for a while (months/years). All troubled oil producers will benefit from this, all large oil consumers will hurt."	d73dss	2019-09-21 13:16:03

The draft was ended when the military moved to an all-volunteer system (I think 1973). However, the Selective Service System remains as a contingency plan and all males 18-25 are required to register so that a draft can be enacted when needed.

Saudi Arabia did not attack the US on 9/11. A radical group of mostly Saudi-born Islamic extremists known as The Hamburg Cell, organized by Mohammed Atta and under the direction primarily of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, with Osama bin Laden's blessing, attacked America. The bin Laden's certainly have ties to the scummy royal family. Saudi Arabia is a dangerous actor in the Middle East that the US has tolerated for a long time. Some ancillary members of the royal family and intelligence agencies do support, finance, and embolden terrorist sects. Just like the Pakistani ISI. Until Donald Trump began profiting from them as President, the Saudis were always treated as a necessary evil. Better to be talking to and trading with than to isolate, that way you can build leverage and favor. This is too far beyond the pale. Beyond even funding the Saudi war on Yemen off the books. 

All of which is to say, it's not right or accurate to conflate the 9/11 hijackers and the entire Saudi kingdom. There's too much of that happening here."	d73dss	2019-09-21 12:42:57

Democrats profess that Trump is reincarnated Hitler, but don't have the integrity to revoke the AUMF so that Trump would be forced to beg for Congress' permission to engage in war.

>Former Presidents [George W.

The point is when someone knocks out 6% of the world's oil supply, you can't just look the other way, someone has to do something about it or else they keep doing it and bring down the world economy.

I'm not saying war is absolutely the answer.  But there needs to be some type of response diplomatic, economic, military or otherwise to prevent this from continuing.  I'm in support of alternative energy sources, but today the world still runs on oil.

And sending troops to Saudi Arabia does not mean Trump wants to go to war.  It's a measured response.  Would liberals rather we sit idly by?  We let Nazi Germany invade it's neighbors and that led to Hitler, two world wars and 6 million Jews exterminated. 

My prediction is that there's no way Trump will go to war.

I actually think he’s afraid of a war in the Middle East, he pulled back on air strikes when he had the chance to retaliate after Iran shot down a drone.

He’s a coward and a bully who makes a lot of threats but is too afraid to follow up on them.

4070	1569071788.0	"I'm not a Trump supporter but I'll give it a go.

Firstly: lemme get this out of the way real quick. It's not about oil. Not really.

The Middle-East is fucked down to its roots. Fucked in a way that's almost impossible to understand or explain. Some of it is not their fault--colonial powers drawing up arbitrary borders which reflected the various claims they'd all made without regard for the religious and tribal groups it cut in half or tied together when they hated each other--but a lot of it is. For example, the Sunni-Shia split. I'd say 70% their fault, 30% not.

So. Why do we care about the Saudis? Why do we care if Iran or Yemen fire missiles at them?

That's not a bad question but a better question is this. Why did Obama care about the Saudis? Why did George W. Bush? And George H. W. Bush? Why was (both) Clintons? Why was every president, Republican or Democrat, friends with the Saudis when they are such absolutely colossal arseholes who fuck us every chance they get?

Why, Republican or Democrat, is every US president sucking up to Saudi Fucking Arabia?

Because Saudi Arabia is a powder keg of *global* proportions. It is the heart of Islam, containing Mecca and Medina (birthplace of Mohammad), the two holiest sites to Islam. All Muslims must bow toward Mecca when they pray five times a day and, once in their lives, commit the [Hajj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj)--a pilgrimage toward the Kaaba, in Mecca. It is basically the Vatican for Muslims, and it is solely in the hands of Saudi Arabia.

For most Muslims, Saudi Arabia is the heart of Islam and the two are inseparable. To be a friend to Saudi Arabia is to be a friend to Islam. To not be... is to be an enemy.

You're starting to see where I'm going with this. In today's globalist, interconnected, multicultural societies we can't turn on Saudi Arabia because the entire world-wide Muslim community hates the USA with a bitter burning passion *as it is*, and it would get so much worse if Saudi Arabia were our North Korea. Imagine the domestic problems we would have, or Europe would have with their millions of Muslims.

*Just imagine*.

So we don't let that happen. We look the other way when they murder people, we ignore their blatant human rights abuses, we don't give a fuck. We stand up loud and proud and say Saudi Arabia are ""our partners in peace"".

Because they are. They, and Israel, are basically the US's only friends in the region. The only ones willing to let the US use their airbases. Their ports. Their land for their military logistical train.

We care about Saudi Arabia being attacked because apart from Israel, they're the only friend the US has in the region.

That's it.

That's why.

It doesn't get much more complex than that. We are using them. They are using us as well--as buyers for their single sole, finite exportable resource, as suppliers for every single one of their luxury goods, for their construction materials, for *everything*. They send out oil and Wahabbist Islam and import *everything else*. And we are happy with this arrangement because they have two other things that they have.

They control Mecca, and they let the USA use its territory as a military staging ground. Because of those two factors we have to pretend to be their friends even though they hate us and we hate them."	d73dss	2019-09-21 15:16:28

Along with Reagan sending troops to Lebanon, Bush putting troops in Saudi Arabia and our general backing of dictators in the Muslim World has been one of the worst foreign policy fumbles in American history.

- No more money for VA or things like that.

and then he changed his mind at the last secomd? Or remember him insisting on an immediate withdrawal from Syria against the advice of literally everyone? And he *just* just fired John Bolton, chief cheerleader of the ""invade Iran"" faction, after a relatively brief tenure during which he didn't give Bolton anything he wanted. 

I have no idea what the source of his discomfort is (certainly it's not empathy or moral convictions) but it seems relatively strong.

4354	1569106011.0	"You have poorly summarized the history of the crisis in Yemen. You make it sound as if Saudi Arabia arbitrarily began attacking Yemen. 

Saudi Arabia's issue with Yemen rests solely with the Houthi militia... the guys with the flag that states: ""God is Greater, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam"". Saudi Arabia is in direct defense of Yemen's legitimate government and military forces at this very moment.

Houthi fighters deliberately target civilians. I specifically use the word target for a reason. While Saudi Arabia has killed a great number of civilians over the course of the war with the Houthis, they don't deliberately target them. The same can be said of the US military. Try as any military may, nobody has found a way to entirely mitigate collateral damage. 

This doesn't mean that I agree with everything that Saudi Arabia does or condone the killing of innocent civilians. I'm merely attempting to shed light on both sides. While every single instance of collateral damage by Saudi Arabia can be expected to make it to the news, you don't even hear a proportional peep about the guys who are deliberately killing the same civilians for refusing them aid, refusing to join their cause, or assisting the legitimate government. These are the same people who fire rockets, launch mortars, shoot artillery, and launch attack drones directly from populated areas knowing the danger it puts civilians in. 

Don't like Saudi Arabia? That's fine. I don't expect you to. But don't just ignore all the facts that don't support your side.

As a side note: If you're an American, Israeli, or if you're Jewish I think you should probably cheer for the lesser of two evils here if you don't like Saudi Arabia. If the Houthis have their way they would kill literally every last one of you. See their flag again for confirmation. 

All of this aside, I'm with you in wishing that none of this had to happen. I would absolutely love if everyone could get along and not want to kill each other. And I don't like the oil problem any more than the next guy either. But we need it until we have a better solution that's viable for everyone.

Much of the 2003 invasion of Iraq came through Saudi Arabia. They are a strategic ally in the region who are useful for American military. The fact that they sell their oil in American dollars is great for American soft power. There are benefits to our relationship with Saudi Arabia.

There's also the downside that we don't really share common values with Saudi Arabia, like, at all. The common values start and end with our mutual dislike of Iran. If you're unfamiliar with why the US hates Iran, it is because Iran nationalized their oil production in the 1950s. In the US government's eyes, Iran stole from American companies that had invested in the oil industry of Iran. This is similar to the reasons behind the Cuba embargo. Frequently, there is talk about 'US interests.' That's basically code for ""what's good for US business.""

5031	1569416922.0	Because the USA is a vassal state of Saudi Arabia. Saudi was behind 9/11 and the USA did nothing. Weeks after they crashed planes into our buildings, our sad excuse of a President was hugging the very men who funded and planned it. Boycott, Divest and Sanction Saudi.	d73dss	2019-09-25 15:08:42

B) He was not afraid of telling a GOP President that war in the middle east would be a good idea.

Trump has gone all in on our alliance with Saudi Arabia who are locked in a proxy was with Iran mostly centering in Yemen. My understanding is that Saudi Arabia is welcoming of US aid but it puts our thumbs even more on the scale in a delicate regional conflict."	d73dss	2019-09-21 16:35:19

5142	1569077712.0	"I'm an expat from the UK. I live in a multicultural area in NL, mostly immigrants. I have a bigger house here than I ever thought I'd manage, purchased in my name with a great low-rate and fully insured mortgage (meaning even if there's a housing crash I'll get the house cost back).

I don't speak Dutch, which is horribly ignorant of me (I have issues with learning new skills, but that's beside the point, I should make more effort). Yet, even after discovering how many years I've been here, most people are patient and work with me in English. There's a Turkish family living next door who don't speak English, but their matriarch insists in talking to me (at length) about my terrible gardening and often offers to help trim/weed via gesticulations and emphatic Dutch words.

My other neighbours are Polish, some Afro-Carribean, some Dutch. They are all lovely people.

The nation has its issues - a growing right-wing sentiment, but it hasn't taken hold strongly, and a bizarre cultural quirk of being welcoming, but also very frank & honest that leads to a lot of people saying things that can be uncomfortable, but not acting on them. As a trans friend of mine put it, you'll hear more aggressive and upsetting comments on being trans in NL than anywhere else, but you'll also get the best support and the least chance of physical harm.

 Saudi Arabia is now bombing Yemen markets and hospitals, which will kill 100,000 people this year. And not only are we selling them those weapons, we are refueling their aircrafts in air. The War Powers Resolution put a little bit of pressure, to get us to stop refueling.

All the Congress and Senate led by politicians across the politcal aisle from Bernie Sanders to Rand Paul. Passed the War Powers Resolution act. Even Mitch Mcconnell let this get through. To revoke our involvement in a Genocide. 

And Donald Trump vetoed it.

This is another one of those American ""are we the baddies?"" moments, and you'll find that is 90% of our foreign policy anyway.

So, know the situation at hand: Yemeni soldiers retaliated from Saudi Arabia's long and savage aggression by striking at their most valuable commodity, likely in the hopes to weaken Saudi relations with the USA and other world powers. **This was not an attack of unprovoked aggression.** Not a single life was taken in the oil refinery attack, whereas Human Rights Watch puts Saudi intervention in Yemen at tens of thousands of innocents targeted and killed, and a UN charter said in 2017 that hundreds of thousands of children were on the verge of death by starvation or severe medical complications. **This is not okay.**

What is happening is an utter purposeful misrepresentation of the situation at hand. The Houthis in Yemen are by all means not *good*, but they are not committing *genocide* either, and their recent attack for which the USA is now eager to use as casus belli for the staging of a new Iraq was by comparison to Saudi's war crimes *literally nothing*."	d73dss	2019-09-21 12:53:42

Iran has been accused of supporting the Houthis, so Trump is trying to say that Iran essentially caused the attacks.

Curious how Trump never mentions that Kim ""Beautiful Letters"" Jong-un also supports the Houthis."	d73dss	2019-09-21 14:30:03
5571	1569071336.0	"Something is fishy about all this. Why would Iran do it? That's my first question. What's their motive? Do they really want to go to war with a neighbor? I've not really heard much talk of that. Then there's all the vague, ""The missiles came from the north."" Again that's unusually vague. Normally we're given a very precise launch area. Maps showing the path of the missiles etc. Don't we have warships with sophisticated radar going up and down the gulf right now yet none of them picked up on these incoming missiles?

And it's quite out of the blue. Iran, as far as I'm aware, hasn't attacked a neighbor unprovoked like this for a long time. And if it is them, why attack a very conspicuous target and then say, ""it wasn't us"" ?

What do you achieve by attacking a target then denying it was you? If you want to send a message you kinda need people to know it was you.

I'm not saying it wasn't Iran just that I feel ill at ease with what's happening here as it doesn't add up and all feels a bit contrived. 

And not to mention we've heard plenty of what the president feels about this but I've not yet heard any commentary from the Saudi leaders. Why is the president taking centre stage over this while the nation that was attacked is oddly absent?

Certainly one thing I can't deny the current US president has achieved is to make me far more deeply suspicious and questioning of world events. And right now there are two scenarios I find quite plausible, within the realms of not being unexpected:

1) Israel manufactured this to look like Iran. They probably have the most to gain by Arabic nations and the US going to war with each other and they are very good at pulling off this kind of underhand deceptive action.

2) manufactured by the Saudis and the US to look like Iran. If these countries want to go to war with Iran and you want to force it to happen then you're going to have to sacrifice a high profile target in order to make it look convincing.

There's a fine line between being considered a conspiracy theorist or merely healthily questioning and untrusting of what leaders tell you. But  I'm afraid Trump doesn't embolden trust in the era we live in. He's made us feel the way we do. So now I'm deeply suspicious of anything where Trump takes centre stage. And I'm not convinced by what I'm hearing."	d73dss	2019-09-21 15:08:56

In short, I was a racketeer; a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.

Someone just rather effectively attacked an infrastructure choke point.  There are *many* significant weak points in *many* systems throughout the world.  Places or things that if significantly damaged could cause severe or long lasting problems.  This was one of those.

It does not *directly* affect the US since we're not quite so dependent upon Saudi oil.  But it caused an immediate 15% jump in oil prices which will likely turn into a widespread price increase in food and many things shipped.  It may have significant impacts on China and to a lesser degree India in the upcoming months... which could have indirect effects on the US as well.

Absolutely not going to happen. The US military is actually pretty good at being apolitical. So long as Trump isn't ordering them to do something blatantly illegal or absolutely heinous, they will follow orders. And even if he does order those things, there's no way to know how the military will react. They aren't brainwashed, but following orders is kind of the default when you don't know what to do.

1. When it comes to human rights, religious freedoms, and democratic values that we, the U.S., supposedly support - KSA is notoriously bad. There are no elections, it's just strict royal family rule. Islamic law is more fundamental in KSA than any other nation: businesses are required to close for the 7-times-daily prayer calls; non-Muslims aren't even allowed to enter the city of Mecca; women must be covered in public, etc. Ideologically and ethically, KSA stands for everything we're not supposed to support. But oil and military sales, so we let it go...which undermines our legitimacy whenever we say we promote democracy, human rights...yada yada yada.
2. MBS just fucking slaughtered an American journalist last year.
3. Yemen.
4. I'll never understand why we continue to side with KSA vs Iran. With the exception of justified animosity towards our own actions in Iran, Iran's flavor of Islam has been much more moderate and tolerant. I always hear about Sharia law and Theocratic rule in the context of Iran, but a) that's mostly our fault, and b) KSA is much worse.

6020	1569102451.0	"It's less so ""Middle East"" but, surprisingly if you read the notes on these issues from Bush Sr and Obama they also had the best administration takes on this stuff. What complicates much of the problem with troops and Saudi Arabia is that of all the regions, troops \*IN\* Saudi Arabia tends to piss of Muslims from across the spectrum. Much of it, if you go by Bush Sr's administration and intelligence before, during and after his administration is due to the Kaaba in Mecca. Essentially if they knew then what they knew by the turn of the century, they really didn't have a comprehension that the optics of US soldiers on the land of Saudi Arabian would've been considered an affront to Islam to a broad spectrum who revere the Kaaba as among one of the most holiest sites in Islam in general. 

So it's the optics that are created in the Muslim world of troops in Saudi Arabia that is far worse in general than say Iran, Iraq, Kuwait or so on. Likewise, while we have a military presence already in Saudi Arabia, its been on the downturn in terms of overall presence, that presence being broadcasted to the world and the reasons for being there. 

In much of the reviews from the 2nd term of Bush Jr and Obama's administration, the thing that stands out is that Osama Bin Laden began to declare the US as an ""enemy"" because of the first Iraq war where troops were allowed to us Saudi Arabia as a forwarding station. That being said Obama and the military brass had probably among the biggest rifts of any modern presedency; Obama was if anything calculated on the costs of civilian lives and the overall dangers of those lives lost being utilized as ammunition for terrorist propaganda. And before anyone jumps the wagon about Obama dropping the most bombs, that only serves the main point that he dropped more bombs on targets than any President prior and had among the lowest calculated collateral damage \[which isn't a friendly term but pardon the military parlance\]. It also doesn't imply he was ""good"" as an ethical argument but he was arguably extremely attentive to the situation of the middle east. 

Likewise while a power vacuum was assumed and correctly occurred in troop withdrawals under Obama in the middle east, it also was equally true had we stayed; many of the US backed figures and parties lost immense support and suffered brutal election results. While a power vacuum isn't easy or enjoyable it would've avoided the quagmire of trying to figure how long we can continue to prop up a national government without the dangers of needing troops elsewhere. 

Thus, the middle east, per se, isn't correct in and of itself but rather breaking down the fact that the ""middle east"" conceived as a term is something meaningful and different to various groups and that its always a long-term problem historically speaking when we increase troop numbers in Saudi Arabia or make it appear as if we are in Saudi Arabia fighting Muslims \[which is technically true to an extent but its an optics issue that plagues us and literally ties us into more terrorism propaganda when someone associates US troops and Mecca\]."	d73dss	2019-09-21 23:47:31

The truth is that the Saudi Royal Family plays a disproportionate role in American foreign policy because of the large swaths of US debt they hold along with massive wealth invested in the US stock market. Democrats and Republicans alike give Saudi royalty special treatment, although Trump's taken it to a fresh level. Big losses to Saudi oil production will affect US gas prices which no one here wants. The force being sent is relatively small, ""not thousands,"" and will be primarily engaged in missile defense. Their presence alone acts as a deterrent from further attack because any American deaths could invite a bigger response from the US military which Yemen simply can't handle. It's a safe, measured response, so I'm sure Trump was barely involved with the decision, if he were involved at all. 

Meanwhile, Trump is spending political capital he doesn't have. He's committing US troops to a shady foreign power to follow a news cycle that he made a shady promise to a foreign power. For many Americans, the memory of Iraq and the years we spent there over Bush's lies is personal, particularly among his base. He's digging his own grave with this. Even if it is unrelated to the whistle blower story, the optics are horrible, and it is certainly not ""America First.""

That's after she spent years denying it.  At Harvard she listed herself as a minority but when caught she tried to blame the university for listing her that way. Harvard was then forced to prove she was the one who did it because they would be guilty of falsely claiming to have recruited a minority for  federal filings in regard to faculty diversity. Then it another document showed she listed herself as a minority at U. Penn. The cat was out of the bag. She was busted. She finally admitted it under so much pressure  but, get this, she said she did it  to ""meet people for lunch"".

Of course now there are documents such as her Texas bar registration that shows she's got a lot more explaining to do. It's all just in relation to her law career. She found a way to get into Harvard law and other exclusive $$$$ university jobs using false claims of minority status.  

She's toast. If she gets the nomination everything I just wrote will become known by more and more people. Most people, who even know about this  just think she claimed to be a Native American to sound more exclusive but she did it to get ahead. The second she tried to blame it on Harvard she ended any chance this would just go away. They openly started to promote her as a minority staff member. In 1997 Fordham Law Review  described her as Harvard Law School's ""first woman of color,"". The blonde haired blue eyed Elizabeth Warren was Harvard Laws first woman of color. Let that sink in. Even  left wing reporters found proof;

Then she tried to say she had a Cherokee in her blood because she has high cheekbones. Then she took a DNA test and the wording of the DNA test made her think she had native blood but it was only a description of a gene found in the blood in natives in a place in south america that had founder genes from Eurasia.  Then based on those percentages the DNA actually showed Elizabeth Warren has less genetic signatures for Native American ancestry than the average European-American. Then Cherokee genealogist searched the historical record for a Cherokee in her bloodline. There was none. The only mention of a Cherokee in any historical record is a newspaper article showing that her great-grandfather shot one. 

She's done.

> 9/11 WAS NOT A SAUDI ARABIAN ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL, IT WAS A TERRORIST GROUP

It was a terrorist group that Saudi Arabia helped fund.

> Saudi Arabia was ATTACKED for their oil. 

No. This is an idiotic claim. Their oil output will be reduced because of the attack. Your comment makes no sense, because nobody benefits from less oil. They were attacked as retaliation for their war crimes in Yemen. 

> Like is that supposed to be ok?

Let them deal with it. They have the most powerful military in the Middle East.

> We already have troops in Saudi Arabia (what, you didn’t know we have a Middle Eastern military presence?)

Pull them out.

> Sending more troops to Saudi Arabia helps AMERICAN SOLDIERS stationed there from more Iranian attacks. 

There is no evidence Iran committed the attack. You've bought into the Fox propaganda. You should not believe a single thing lying Donald says. He has lied thousands of times. Lying destroys credibility. You should not believe people with no credibility.

> It’s literally a few hundred soldiers. 

It's the symbolism of support that's a huge problem. And, if it's only a few hundred soldiers, how the hell are a few hundred soldiers going to defend against ""Iranian attacks""? You're not making any sense and you contradicted yourself in the same post.

> Obama has taken out more innocent citizens with 1 drone strike.

Non-sequitur. Obama has nothing to do with this. He is not the president. This has nothing to do with US drone strikes. This has nothing to do with death counts. This has everything to do with a lying administration and lying ""president"" that's bent on starting a new war to protect his re-election chances."	d73dss	2019-09-22 03:25:04

Let's rewind a little. When the ayatollahs took over in Iran in 1979, the Saudis started worrying. Then there was the whole seige at Mecca, and they decided that the ayatollahs had to go. They reached out to their buddy Saddam and convinced him to take on Iran. That resulted in the Iran-Iraq war of the 80s. After the stalemate and the war ended, with ayatollahs still in power, Kuwait and KSA asked Saddam to return the loans they had given him to fight the war.

""Loans?!? What loans?!?! I thought those were grants!"" he replied.

""Nope, sorry! You didn't win the war, so we want our money back"".

Saddam then decided to invade Kuwait. After all, once he took over Kuwait, he could just cancel the debt! Brilliant!

Saddam's takeover of Kuwait made the Saudis start shitting bricks. ""What if he does the same to us?"", they whimpered. 

Osama had just got done fighting the Soviets and kicking them out of Afghanistan. He volunteered to lead the KSA army against Saddam, if they gave him full control of the Saudi miiitary. ""Ummm, thanks, but no thanks!"" replied the Saudis. They preferred to sign up with Bush & Co for their home security needs. They knew that if they gave so much power to Osama, they first thing he'd do would be to kick them out of their palaces.

This infuriated Osama, who was a religious nut by then. He found it greatly insulting that *Christians* would be defending the Two Shrines, the 2 holiest places in Islam. Then he swore revenge on the USA.  But not so much on KSA, because they were still plying him with cash to stay away.

6480	1569055087.0	"Iraq was one of two reasons W. declined so badly. What ""worked"" for W. was appearing presidential and unifying after 9/11. That gave him carte blanche to do anything, with which he invaded Iraq."	d73dss	2019-09-21 10:38:07

6503	1569065101.0	I think it was more about the idea that we're sending troops to Saudi Arabia to use in a war FOR Saudi Arabia, like attacking Iran for their alleged attack on Saudi Arabia's oil. It's not that we're sending troops there to fight Saudi Arabia...even though they were responsible for 9/11 and it would make a hell of a lot more sense than any of the other war's we've been part of for the last two decades.	d73dss	2019-09-21 13:25:01

When the GOP is openly defacing the rule of law and harming-- not just making life harder, but harming and killing-- regular people, what do you do to put a stop to it?  How do you wait and hope that somehow, for election day, they will decide to play by the rules for that one day if they lose?

They're scumbags now, they were scumbags then, they just cared to hide it because they had shame and didn't know that half of Americans would just go along with whatever they said.

Bolton wanted this war because it’s what he does for the republican establishment and some demented sense of American superiority. Their difference of opinion was likely that Trump wants to have this war in his pocket as leverage simply to save himself.

Another way to interpret this is that Trump’s approval rating has not risen since his election and is six points below when he was elected. Now it is within a point or two of the *lowest* point of Obama’s Presidency.
  
If you look at [Obama’s full presidency](https://qz.com/889644/obamas-approval-rating-from-his-first-day-to-his-last-in-charts/) his mean approval rating is much higher than Trump’s. [Wikipedia confirms it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating) showing Obama’s average 47 to Trump’s 40. One last [link from Quinnipiac](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3638) shows Trump pretty disadvantaged.

Well, come on all of you, big strong men,

Uncle Sam needs your help again.

He's got himself in a terrible jam

Way down yonder in Vietnam

So put down your books and pick up a gun,

We're gonna have a whole lotta fun.

And it's one, two, three,

What are we fighting for ?

Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,

Next stop is Vietnam;

And it's five, six, seven,

Open up the pearly gates,

Well there ain't no time to wonder why,

Whoopee! we're all gonna die.

Come on Wall Street, don't be slow,

Why man, this is war au-go-go

There's plenty good money to be made

By supplying the Army with the tools of its trade,

But just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb,

They drop it on the Viet Cong.

And it's one, two, three,

What are we fighting for ?

Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,

Next stop is Vietnam.

And it's five, six, seven,

Open up the pearly gates,

Well there ain't no time to wonder why

Whoopee! we're all gonna die.

Well, come on generals, let's move fast;

Your big chance has come at last.

Now you can go out and get those reds

'Cause the only good commie is the one that's dead

And you know that peace can only be won

When we've blown 'em all to kingdom come.

And it's one, two, three,

What are we fighting for ?

Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,

Next stop is Vietnam;

And it's five, six, seven,

Open up the pearly gates,

Well there ain't no time to wonder why

Whoopee! we're all gonna die.

Come on mothers throughout the land,

Pack your boys off to Vietnam.

Come on fathers, and don't hesitate

To send your sons off before it's too late.

And you can be the first ones in your block

To have your boy come home in a box.

And it's one, two, three

What are we fighting for ?

Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,

Next stop is Vietnam.

And it's five, six, seven,

Open up the pearly gates,

Well there ain't no time to wonder why,

Whoopee! we're all gonna die."	d73dss	2019-09-21 12:33:02

7007	1569076353.0	"That depends on what it means to be from a 'conservative area'. I mean, on one hand, [Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Virginia, and Arizona all provided disproportionately large numbers of recruits to the US armed forces as of 2016](https://www.cfr.org/article/demographics-us-military), and all of those states with the notable exception of Virginia skew pretty conservative in elections, so you might call those 'conservative areas'.

However, some of those states -- like Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia -- are also some of the states with the highest percentages of black residents in the US. At the same time, all branches of the armed forces except for the Marine Corps -- when compared to the civilian labor force -- were made up of disproportionately low numbers of white people and disproportionately high numbers of black people [as of 2016](https://www.cfr.org/article/demographics-us-military) (although they *were* all still mostly made up of white people, like American society also is).

So, unless we're assuming that all of the black people entering the armed forces from those big military recruiting states skew as conservative as their respective home states do in elections, then the observation that those states skew conservative in elections is probably of only marginal significance (if any).

The point is that nobody gets to claim the armed forces as belonging to one group or another. On the whole, the armed forces are about as ethnically and culturally diverse as American society is (even if conservative views tend to dominate, but then, white people and males *do* still numerically dominate there).

Speaking for myself, the armed forces are, despite everything, *by far* the most diverse and least de-facto-segregated place that I ever found myself in."	d73dss	2019-09-21 16:32:33

It's more theorizing what would be required in a war with Iran. Iran is not a pushover nation. They have advanced military hardware and a lot of capable troops. This would not be Iraq. It would be a long, costly war. Costly regarding US military lives. A draft might end up being a necessity. Or so the thinking goes.

The Domino policy of Eisenhower still applies here, except it's the loss of friendly oil producing nations to the insurgents, Iran-backed or not, rather than the fear of communism.

Yes, she was a fiscal conservative through her mid-late 40s, and a centrist Democrat until the past decade, but she has been solidly consistent in her present message for more than a decade. Madelleine Albright was one of her mentors during the 90s and they remain friends, it's totally understandable why she has been endorsed. Is Warren the perfect candidate? No such thing. Is she a ""wolf in sheep's clothing""? There is absolutely nothing to suggest it's all a ruse.

I personally think it's a bit disengenuous to criticize someone's political change of heart that is documented to have happened over two decades, not two years or months as we often see. Do we not want to see people change their minds, and then their votes? It's what we hope to see in Republicans is it not? Well here we have one, that evolved over time. And we shit on her for it?

Pulling troops out of an area we helped to de-stablize with years of war, with no real exit plan or solid timetable, in a way that will only cause further issues: A bad idea.

Putting troops into an area they don't need to go/have no business being, which will in the end possibly/likely cause a situation like the one above: Also a bad idea.

It was a terrorist group that Saudi helped fund. I mean, with that logic, the US is responsible for every atrocity committed by ISIS.

Sorry, not for their oil, they were attacked at an oil site. The point being, they were attacked. Your stance is we should not involve ourselves whatsoever. Personally I agree with that stance, I wish America didn’t get involved with foreign affairs, but sadly the precedent has been set. Middle eastern meddling has been going on since Bush Sr, and pulling out now isn’t going to solve the problem over there. Staying might not either, but it’s not as simple as “pull them out.” ESPECIALLY right after an attack... when Russia is supporting the attackers. That would be a real power move to pull out right now LOL.

Okay, I mean you can deny it was the Iranians. See how that goes for you.

The symbolism is the problem? Then why weren’t the troops stationed there previously a problem? Why is this being considered an act of war? (Not saying you’re calling this an act of war, but just look at some of the other comments on here.) If you don’t want to support SA, that’s a fair opinion, but it’s not like this is some war mongering move made by trump, it is exactly what any other president would do in this situation.

Theres 1 or 2 who are legit supporters and more who'd vote for him because of a lack of good Democrat opposition but that doesnt stop us acknowledging that he's not competent. Most single, younger troops want to deploy, actually (but this could be very specific to my career field). Its good for your career and the actual threat is pretty low-- depending on where you go. The closer you go to Yemen, the higher the threat, but we know that most Huthi's won't strike americans so it's still a relatively safe bet. Still, deployment isnt really seen as a bad thing. Not everyone gets to do it and it can be a real worthwhile experience, so long as you don't get killed.	d73dss	2019-09-21 11:32:50

>	“Your alleged kingdom [...], in reality, is nothing else but an American protectorate governed by the American Constitution.”

This was in a scathing letter by Osama bin Laden addressed to King Fahd of Saudi in 1995. That Osama came from one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the Kingdom made this statement against the king even more noteworthy ([source](https://ctc.usma.edu/harmony-program/open-letter-to-king-fahd-from-bin-laden-original-language-2/)).

(Side note: in the same letter, bin Laden also wrote “*You will not disagree with us as well that the Saudi army, despite the astronomical amounts squandered for it, is in fact but a pile of stacked weapons and equipment lacking the manpower to use*”, which is somewhat prophetic in light of Saudi’s recent failure to protect its oil & gas infrastructure against airborne threats; and which is now used to justify renewed American interventionism ([source](https://edition-m.cnn.com/2019/09/19/middleeast/saudi-air-defense-analysis-intl/index.html))).

The following year, in 1996, Osama bin Laden issued his first of two directives (*fatwa*) asking combatants (*mujahideen*) to wage holy war (*jihad*) against Western presence in what he considered to be sacred land (Saudi) due to the presence of the two holy mosques (Mecca and Medina) ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fataw%C4%81_of_Osama_bin_Laden)).

The rest, as they say, is history: 9/11 happened. Osama bin Laden’s “Letter to America” (2002) mentioned the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi as one of the chief motivations for the terrorist attack ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

The American troops left Saudi soil in 2003 after having overthrown Saddam Hussein. Why the withdrawal? This is what then-Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz had to say about it ([source](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2003/05/31/paul-wolfowitz-and-vanity-fair/)):

>	[...] we can now remove almost all of our forces from Saudi Arabia. Their presence there over the last 12 years has been a source of enormous difficulty for a friendly government. It’s been a huge recruiting device for al Qaeda. In fact if you look at bin Laden, one of his principle grievances was the presence of so-called crusader forces on the holy land, Mecca and Medina. I think just lifting that burden from the Saudis is itself going to open the door to other positive things.

In July 2019, it was announced the U.S. troops would return to Saudi’s Prince Sultan Air Base (i.e. decision was made before the latest aerial attack on the oil & gas facility this week). The crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), is betting that the anti-Iran sentiment among Sunnis is strong enough for them to ignore their own anti-US sentiment ([source](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/07/did-mohammed-bin-salman-just-give-jihadis-the-worlds-greatest-terrorist-recruiting-tool-usa-troops-saudi-arabia-osama-bin-laden/)).

The US are willing to take that risk of flaring up Islamic terrorism once more on a bet made by MBS.

The problem is that the US is still the largest consumer of oil on the planet and the oil and its production they have is mostly in private hands (as opposed to state owned), so they are still very exposed to international price shocks despite being self sufficient. If the global price of oil rises, internal prices have to rise as well otherwise people will just export it. Hence the US getting involved militarily to protect foreign oil sources, because if Saudi refineries, the Straits of Hormuz, etc get shut down then global prices will rise.

Bin Laden heavily criticized Saudi Arabia for accepting military help from the US when Iraqi forces were amassing on their border during the first Gulf War.  For this he was banished from Saudi Arabia and stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994.

Furthermore, the US and Saudi Arabia have been allies since 1945 and entered into a  Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement in 1951.  So we're bound by treaty to step in when they are attacked.

For me, the most concerning part is that even though my family had no money, I grew up around king-makers. So I know *exactly* how much some of these guys’ mouths water when they encounter a useful idiot like trump. 

For them, Trump is an almost *unbelievably* easy mark. It’s like playing chess against someone who’s loosely familiar with checkers:  They easily walk all over him. 

A guy like Rex Tillerson, for example, is a seasoned international powerhouse. Straight up?  He’s spent decades running a corporation that is essentially on par with, if not more influential than, any entity currently in existence, except *maybe* the G7 countries, and even that’s sometimes arguable due to their oil dependencies. 

Meanwhile, Trump can barely fucking read. He can’t coherently articulate more than a sentence or two, if that, and is therefore necessarily incapable of conducting international diplomacy in any real sense, which is basically the U.S. president’s most important role during this epoch.

Only time will tell. The most important thing is that our votes actually still matter, and unfortunately, I think republicans (knowing they’ll lose a fair election) have done everything they can to see that another one is essentially stolen. 

They did it with Bush v. Gore, they did it in 2016, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that they’ll do it again. That’s especially true considering that the GOP knows their hegemony is over. They were defeated by a black man, and then a woman.

>The attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels in the war against a Saudi-led coalition comes after weeks of similar drone assaults on the kingdom's oil infrastructure.

They even officially claimed responsibility:

>In a short address aired by the Houthi's Al-Masirah satellite news channel, military spokesman Yahia Sarie said the rebels launched 10 drones in their coordinated attack on the sites after receiving ""intelligence"" support from those inside the kingdom. He warned that attacks by the rebels would only get worse if the war continues.

So I guess my question is this: why are you so adamantly pushing a narrative that is contrary to all the reporting?

Again, I disagree. By far and large his base voters are agreeable to military engagement when warranted, and if he can justify the use of the armed forces in a police action, or full-on war, it will not lose him votes. In may even gain him voters as a large military strike can spur the economy and give a justification behind the ""I started this, only I can end it"", ""you need me"" rhetoric.

8564	1569075755.0	Good post. I wish more people would study the actual motivations of these groups. The Saudi's didn't create radical Islam, they co-opted it because radical Islam in a nutshell says that institutions like the Saudi dynasty are everything that is wrong with Islam and should be destroyed. By supporting the fanatics, passing harsh laws, and so on, they take the target off of them and how nothing about their rule over the holiest sites in Islam is legitimate. It adds legitimacy that keeps them in power. This is also a part of the reason that they fear Iran so much and that there is a cold war type situation between them.	d73dss	2019-09-21 16:22:35

One glaring example is in alqaedas type ot Salafism..

Monarchies are heretical in Salafism of Alqaeda,  in Saudi Arabia monarchies aren't at all.


Other proponents of Salafism around the world, especially now is Qatar, and the Muslim Brotherhood organisations who call for mandatory hijabs and Saudi mandatory hijabs are not a thing. Alqaedas form of Salafism has roots in qutbism.

And extremism in Islam also comes from non-salafi groups like Hezbullah, and other Shia militias who call for jihad etc.

As I said, surface level understanding of topics and buzz words like wahhabism is a ticket for an argument won here lmao.

A lot of extremists even on the other side are citing wahhabism as a scapegoat for Islamist extremism like the Houthi militias who carry ""curse the jews"" as a banner.

What are the tenants of Wahhabism? Love to see you answer this one.

That’s the part which really hurts, because no matter who is in the office from here on out, it will be increasingly difficult to hold them accountable through our justice system.

I am contacting you today to ask permission to speak with your class(es) about current events going on in today’s world. Now is a great time to briefly talk about these events, considering we just recognized 9/11, and conflicts with Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia are increasing. I am currently scheduled to deploy to the Middle East for nine months (deployment time) to support our efforts overseas regarding these conflicts.

>We often talk about events in today’s economy or politics that solely focus on our own country, however, what we fail to understand is that there are much greater influencers in the world that directly affect the United States, even though we may only be indirectly acting or supporting in certain situations. One example of this is the recent drone strike on one of the world’s largest oil supplies in Saudi Arabia. Oil prices here have increased, but the question among many Americans is “Why should we protect Saudi oil?” There are many more examples of conflicts and events that are happening overseas right now that the general American population is either unaware of or uneducated about.

Some violent, underdeveloped people will be attracted to military and general physical law enforcement, yes.

But, also, the military specifically targets people who don't have much opportunity (and usually who don't have the means to pursue opportunity through education). Since education (and wealth, to a certain degree) are positively correlated with taking a more empathetic view of others, being open-minded, and having more ""liberal"" views in general due to opportunities for exposure...well, unfortunately the military basically attracts people who weren't able to advance through their intelligence (or family means) and will have a fairly narrow minded view of the world / not much exposure to anyone different.

I guess the tl;dr is that...uh, there's a lot of dumb people in the military because that's who the military targets. (Exception of course, are the people targeted to be officers. But, from what I've heard, officers tend to be way more liberal than the grunts.)"	d73dss	2019-09-22 03:56:50

The problem is, despite all the dirty underhanded shit we’ve been pulling there for decades, the average American *does not know about it.* A lot of Americans’ understanding of US-Iranian relations consists of the hostage crisis and whatever could be dredged from reruns of “Homeland.”

Where I live in the US, I could drive hundreds of miles in any direction without reaching an ocean or a national border. Everywhere I went, English would be the only spoken language (with the exception of pocket enclaves in major cities) and the most visible cultural difference would be which football team the locals rooted for. Most people don’t have passports and don’t travel internationally, the exceptions being those sponsored to go on church “mission trips” and those deployed for military service. What kind of impression will an average person have of the Middle East if the only people they know who went there did so as soldiers in an invading and occupying army (who spent their whole time there getting shot at or waiting to get shot at *because* they were part of an invading and occupying army), and the rest comes from Michael Bay and fucking Sean Hannity?

As recently as ten years ago I was that guy. My cousins were deployed to Iraq and I wanted to believe it was for a good cause, so I gravitated towards news sources which told me what I wanted to hear. When they came home, one of them permanently injured, both talking about how it had been for oil, it really shook me. My hometown is home to the largest Yazidi population in the United States (many of them former translators for the Army who relocated here with their families to escape reprisal), and when ISIS started having their way with them over there I was appalled. I had to do a lot of independent research to learn as much as I know now, including years of correspondence with people who live in the region (a chance encounter on Facebook with a Syrian woman has turned into five years of regular contact — I even flew to Istanbul a few years back to meet her and her family in person).

She was studying for the US Medical License Exam. Put years into it, hoping to earn a residency position over here. I got to tell her when Trump’s travel ban happened.

Her hometown (directly on the Syrian-Turkish border) was repeatedly targeted by ISIS car bombings. Most of her family, several of whom I met in person, still live there.

You look at things in the region a lot differently when you actually get to know people who live there, and when those footnotes on the news ticker have translated into phone calls to see if everyone is still OK.

Ultimately, yes, they have the constitutional power of the purse, but the budgetary process is much more nuanced than that and over the last few decades it almost seems like the executive has complete control over the budget.

And to your reply, A war has not been started so you are wrong about that. However, I know that it can start any second but that doesn't mean that a war has started. A small number of troops were sent to be on the defense, not to attack anybody. So this is not a war.  
  
It should also be noted that Saudi is one of the biggest partners of the US. This doesn't have that much to do with Trump as it does with the White house in general. Saudi is deep in the pockets of the White House since the early 1970s ever since the US made a deal with Saudi to peg oil to fiat money. Seems like most people like to ignore this. Ever since then the US and Saudi have been working together to make eachother more powerful through oil and money and Iran is obviously one of the biggest competitors to Saudi just like Iraq use to be and we saw what happened to them.  
  
I don't think people realize the bigger picture because they are way to distracted by Trump and it's honestly sad.  
  
If I were to guess, he approved to send the DEFENSIVE small number of troops just to play the cards right.

If saudi arabia shut off the tap you would see supply get burned and prices shoot up to the point of destabilizing countries. Just look at the 1990 oil shock when kuwait shut off the tap. oil and gas prices nearly tripled which is a major dent in the pockets of many developing countries and businesses.

Iran's state of the art systems are comparable to 70s/80s Soviet S-300 technology, precisely the kind of stuff the F-22 and F-35 were designed to penetrate and mop up.  You can bet those US pilots and aircraft have extensive training and tactics established against defenses of those capabilities.  On the other side, how many stealth aircraft do you think Iran has available to train against?

But I do agree that even though the US could pound Iran from the air with relative impunity, it wouldn't be worth risking even a comparatively small response of terrorist attacks abroad or regional missile strikes before those capabilities could be shut down by the air campaign.  And of course a ground invasion, even if eventually successful in defeating Iran's conventional forces despite the much more difficult terrain and opposition compared to Iraq, would still inevitably end in a quagmire of insurgency that would make Iraq look like a cake walk."	d73dss	2019-09-21 18:21:13

The Saudi government performed a ""dry run"" by paying two Saudi nationals, al-Qudhaeein and Hamdan al-Shalawi, ""living undercover in the US as students, to fly from Phoenix to Washington,"" two years before the attacks. Based on the FBI documents, Qudhaeein and Shalawi were in fact members of ""the Kingdom's network of agents"" in the United States. The documents also revealed that they were ""trained in Afghanistan with a number of other al-Qaeda operatives that participated in the attacks."" In November 1999, they boarded an America West flight to Washington, paid for by the Saudi Embassy.

9270	1569256230.0	"While Saudi Arabia is often a secondary source of funds and support for terror movements who can find more motivated and ideologically invested benefactors, Saudi Arabia arguably remains the most prolific sponsor of international Islamist terrorism, allegedly supporting groups as disparate as the Afghanistan Taliban, Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Al-Nusra Front.[98][99]
Saudi Arabia is said to be the world's largest source of funds and promoter of Salafist jihadism,[100] which forms the ideological basis of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, Taliban, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and others. In a December 2009 diplomatic cable to U.S. State Department staff (made public in the diplomatic cable leaks the following year), U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged U.S. diplomats to increase efforts to block money from Gulf Arab states from going to terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan, writing that ""Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide"" and that ""More needs to be done since Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaeda, the Taliban, LeT and other terrorist groups.""[37] An August 2009 State Department cable also said that the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, which carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks, used a Saudi-based front company to fund its activities in 2005.[37][37][101] to
The violence in Afghanistan and Pakistan is partly bankrolled by wealthy, conservative donors across the Arabian Sea whose governments do little to stop them.[37] Three other Arab countries which are listed as sources of militant money are Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, all neighbors of Saudi Arabia.[37][38]
According to two studies published in 2007 (one by Mohammed Hafez of the University of Missouri in Kansas City and the other by Robert Pape of the University of Chicago), most of suicide bombers in Iraq are Saudis.[102][103][104]
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers of the four airliners who were responsible for 9/11 originated from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, one from Egypt, and one from Lebanon.[105] Osama bin Laden was born and educated in Saudi Arabia.
**Starting in the mid-1970s the Islamic resurgence was funded by an abundance of money from Saudi Arabian oil exports.[106] The tens of billions of dollars in ""petro-Islam"" largess obtained from the recently heightened price of oil funded an estimated ""90% of the expenses of the entire faith.""[107]**
Throughout the Sunni Muslim world, religious institutions for people both young and old, from children's maddrassas to high-level scholarships received Saudi funding,[108] ""books, scholarships, fellowships, and mosques"" (for example, ""more than 1500 mosques were built and paid for with money obtained from public Saudi funds over the last 50 years""),[109] along with training in the Kingdom for the preachers and teachers who went on to teach and work at these universities, schools, mosques, etc.[110] The funding was also used to reward journalists and academics who followed the Saudis' strict interpretation of Islam; and satellite campuses were built around Egypt for Al Azhar, the world's oldest and most influential Islamic university.[111]
The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism. In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only ""always oppose"" infidels ""in every way"", but ""hate them for their religion ... for Allah's sake"", that democracy ""is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century"", that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were ""infidels"", etc.[112] According to former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, while this effort has by no means converted all, or even most, Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations of Islam in Southeast Asia, and to pitch the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the ""gold standard"" of religion in minds of Muslims across the globe.[113]
Patrick Cockburn accused Saudi Arabia of supporting extremist Islamist groups in the Syrian Civil War, writing: ""In Syria, in early 2015, it supported the creation of the Army of Conquest, primarily made up of the al-Qaeda affiliate the al-Nusra Front and the ideologically similar Ahrar al-Sham, which won a series of victories against the Syrian Army in Idlib province.""[114]
While the Saudi government denies claims that it exports religious or cultural extremism, it is argued that by its nature, Wahhabism encourages intolerance and promotes terrorism.[115] Former CIA director James Woolsey described it as ""the soil in which Al-Qaeda and its sister terrorist organizations are flourishing.""[116] In 2015, Sigmar Gabriel, Vice-Chancellor of Germany, accused Saudi Arabia of supporting intolerance and extremism, saying: ""Wahhabi mosques are financed all over the world by Saudi Arabia. In Germany, many dangerous Islamists come from these communities.""[117][118] In May 2016, The New York Times editorialised that the kingdom allied to the U.S. had ""spent untold millions promoting Wahhabism, the radical form of Sunni Islam that inspired the 9/11 hijackers and that now inflames the Islamic State"".[119] Iranian Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst with ties to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said, “ISIS ideologically, financially and logistically is fully supported and sponsored by Saudi Arabia...They are one and the same”.[120]
In 2014, former Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki stated that Saudi Arabia and Qatar started the civil wars in Iraq and Syria, and incited and encouraged terrorist movements, like ISIL and al-Qaeda, supporting them politically and in the media, with money and by buying weapons for them. Saudi Arabia denied the accusations which were criticised by the country, the Carnegie Middle East Center and the Royal United Services Institute.[121][122]
One of the leaked Podesta emails from August 2014, addressed to John Podesta, identifies Saudi Arabia and Qatar as providing ""clandestine,"" ""financial and logistic"" aid to ISIL and other ""radical Sunni groups."" The email outlines a plan of action against ISIL, and urges putting pressure on Saudi Arabia and Qatar to end their alleged support for the group.[123][124] Whether the email was originally written by Hillary Clinton, her advisor Sidney Blumenthal, or another person is unclear.[125]
Following the 2017 Tehran attacks, Iranian authorities such as members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif, have accused Saudi Arabia of being behind the attacks.[126][127] In a Twitter post, Zarif wrote, ""Terror-sponsoring despots threaten to bring the fight to our homeland. Proxies attack what their masters despise most: the seat of democracy"". His statements referred to the Saudi deputy crown prince Mohammad bin Salman's threats against the country about a month earlier, in which bin Salman revealed their policy to drag the regional conflict into Iranian borders.[126][127][128] Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, denied his country's involvement in the attacks and said Riyadh had no knowledge of who was responsible for them.[129] He condemned terrorist attacks and killing of the innocent ""anywhere it occurs"".[129]
Bob Corker, chairman of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, stated that the Saudi support for terrorism ""dwarfs what Qatar is doing""; the statement was made after Saudi Arabia cut ties with Qatar, citing alleged support of terrorism by the latter.[130]
According to Newsweek, the United Kingdom government may decide to keep secret the results of an official inquiry into the supporters of the Islamist militant groups in the country. The findings are believed to have references to Saudi Arabia.[131]
Following various accusations relating to sponsoring terrorism, Saudi Arabia became eager to join the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF). However, a review conducted by the FATF on Saudi’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing system, pointed that the kingdom has not been able to tackle the risk of terrorism financing by third-party and facilitators, as well as individuals financing international terrorist organizations.[132][133]
In 2019, Saudi Arabia has been granted a full membership of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) becoming the first Arab country awarded this full membership. This was following the group’s Annual General Meeting in Orlando. The group is responsible for designing and issuing standards and policies that face money laundering and terrorist financing.[134]
On 25 June 2019, the Arab Coalition has revealed that Saudi and Yemeni special forces had captured Abu Osama al-Muhajir, the leader (emir) of ISIS's network in Yemen. The ISIS's leader, as well as other members of ISIS, were arrested on 3 June 2019 in a house that was under surveillance.[135][136]"	d73dss	2019-09-23 18:30:30

>But there is a good reason why our geopolitical problems are given to people who are significantly smarter than the general public on that particular issue.

Last I checked, the sovereign power in the US flows from the electorate. Are you endorsing autocracy here? That would be fitting from someone who seems to be fairly invested (as it were) in defending one of the world's most autocratic states.

So if there's a formal military alliance with KSA (there isn't), national sentiment sure doesn't seem to reflect that. Is that a failure of our technocratic elite to properly educate the great unwashed? Or is it rather that the larger public aren't the ones financially benefitting from propping up KSA?

You will see the outcome of this current Ukraine investigation when Biden and his imbecilic son get absolutely crushed and Trump gains a few more points from it all. 

So many people I know including myself who were brainwashed by the Liberal media actually looked at Trump on the news and thought how someone like him could have possibly won the election when he's as bad as 'everyone' says he is. All you need to do (or anyone) is a little bit of research and you'll realise how truly corrupt the democrat party has become. No one is taking away my second amendment or my red meat. There's nothing more to say, it's easy to go back and fourth but we just need to wait until 2020 when Trump is handed the presidency for another 4 years. You will see as these current sagas unfold how much the democrats love this country when everything backfires and they get exposed. Then we'll see what they say next year, maybe North Korea will meddle in the next election?

And, if you view unbiased media on the current investigations and the current impeachment inquiry, you will gain a completely different perspective UNLESS you are also that far gone to the point where you'll just continue to spew false, insane claims and hate Trump because the media and Hollywood figures tell you to. Everyone I know including myself went from hating everyone on Fox news, watching Colbert bash Trump which was 'funny' at the time and also cussing at Trump for being a racist, to actually loving him and everything that he has and is currently doing for this country.

Not ""interest"" as in popular interest, ""interest"" as in strategic interest. We're only getting ""peace"" out of this if we define it in such a way as to exclude KSA bombing the shit out of the Houthis for several years. And, of course, whatever else the Saudis decide to stick their noses into.

The strategic interest here is countering Iranian influence.  The Houthis are supported and armed by Iran.  Our alliance with Saudi Arabia has essentially always been to counter some other influence seen as a threat to regional peace and stability, whether that was Russia, Iraq, or Iran.  Whether or not you think that is a legitimate strategic interest is a personal matter, but clearly our government does.

I found exactly 1 poll on the war in Yemen, with a large majority of Americans not supporting our involvement.  Of course that war has received so little coverage that most Americans probably aren't well informed or highly motivated about the issue.  If it is a matter that the voters care about then they will have to get out and vote in 2020, or at least write/call their representatives.

Among those named were then-Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar and Osama Bassnan, a Saudi agent, as well as American al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta, and Esam Ghazzawi, a Saudi adviser to the nephew of King Fahd."	d73dss	2019-09-21 13:35:12

That is the conclusion reached by the 9/11 commission, which included the people who prepared those 28 pages.  [Philip D. Zelikow](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/us/claims-against-saudis-cast-new-light-on-secret-pages-of-9-11-report.html), the executive director of the 9/11 commission, said that:

>Those involved in the preparation of the famous 28 pages joined the staff of the 9/11 Commission and participated in the follow-up investigation of all the leads that had been developed earlier,” he said Wednesday. “In doing so, they were aided by a larger team with more members, more powers and for the first time actually conducted interviews of relevant people both in this country and in Saudi Arabia.

>And what we found is reflected in the commission report.

And the [9/11 commission](http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/index.htm)'s findings with respect to Saudi Arabia were:

>It does not appear that any government other than the Taliban financially supported al Qaeda before 9/11, although some governments may have contained al Qaeda sympathizers who turned a blind eye to al Qaeda’s fundraising activities. Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding, but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.

The people who were on the commission said that the allegations in those 28 pages did not stand up to further scrutiny.  Saudi Arabian citizens were involved, and some lower level government officials did contribute money to al Qaeda, but the Saudi government is not responsible for the attacks."	d73dss	2019-09-21 13:43:24

EDIT jesus christ reddit

There are at least two audiences for an action like this: domestic and international. I am saying the leadership in Iran is probably facing a ton of pressure to do *something* and that the options they have are limited. Suddenly I'm a shill for Iran. I'm not, but definitely feel like my country (the US) is and has been the aggressor for the most part. I think the US should do less meddling and spend more time fixing its domestic problems, not starting wars. You can disagree, and we can agree to disagree. They shoot a drone when pressured, we strike an empty airfield in Syria when we (our leadership) feels pressured - whatever. It's all mostly show for each other and ourselves. 

All intended to say is that Iran likely feels backed into a corner and felt a need to act in some way or another. This was actually a pretty low risk move on their part, and they knew it. Hot fucking take and I'm a shill now. Pay me, Iran."	c3ealo	2019-06-22 04:53:14

&#x200B;

One example from the article (regarding the Mexican war):

&#x200B;

>Polk sent an army into the disputed  territory and planted it directly across the Rio Grande from the dusty  little Mexican town of Matamoros, where a large number of Mexican troops  were stationed. This was highly incendiary, and it inevitably led to a  skirmish in which 11 American soldiers were killed and another 50 or so  captured. Polk promptly sent a message to Congress saying the United  States and Mexico were in a state of war and calling for a congressional  war declaration. 

&#x200B;

Replace the troops on the Rio Grande with a drone flying in or very close to Iranian airspace, and it looks very familiar.

The way many of the comments in here portray and evaluate the policies of your nation is closer to truth than what you have been sold to in your nation - by people whose highest interest in their profession it is for you to think about their policies in ways that you might be inclined to as you read this thread.

There is so much at stake. It is worth it to experience dissonance and emotional discomfort over changing your perspective. So many lives, so much turmoil, a huge, destabilized region that may in a couple of decades struggle for water and desperately need infrastructure and stability. We need it to have infrastructure and stability, for our futures and our children's futures. You, personally, will feel no gain from this war. It will trouble the whole globe.

In all honesty, losing 100 soldiers doesn't mean much, militarily... it only matters morally.  Losing a drone doesn't matter much morally, but it's a big loss militarily.

In the end, going to war for moral, emotional reasons is nice.  But, personally, I find logical, rational military reasons more compelling.  If you don't attack in response to moral threats, often nothing bad happens.  If you don't attack in response to military threats, your whole country, and all the meat bags in it are at risk of death.

That's why the USA, and international community did nothing in Darfur, but feels places in the middle east are worthy of a war.  If nothing is done in Darfur... it doesn't affect us in Europe/USA.  If nothing is done in the middle east, Russia/China/Iran gain control of it, and can now expand in 3 directions, and possibly, in time, overtake the USA/Europe, and force them to submit to their will(like how Europe/USA made Russia and China submit to their will)."	c3ealo	2019-06-22 04:38:30

There are two specific frequencies, called ""guard"" (121.5Mhz and 243.0Mhz) which most airplanes constantly listen to, because airplanes use those frequencies if they're in distress, or if an air traffic controller can't get a hold of an airplane in their airspace.  The Guard freq is also used to alert unknown aircraft approaching national airspace.

&#x200B;

Until Iran and other nations within listening range (UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, US mililtary) release audio recordings of these radio warnings on UHF or VHF guard, any claims that Iran warned the drone of violating national airspace are unfounded."	c3ealo	2019-06-22 07:27:39

1: Iranian or US radio equipment was malfunctioning or it was user error preventing one side from sending/receiving.

2: Iran broadcasted the warning over the Iranian frequency that all aircraft flying in Iran are required to monitor. The US, which claims it was not flying in Iranian airspace, would obviously not be monitoring an Iranian frequency. 

3: Iran's message did get through and the US was basically like FU bro we in internationally recognized airspace.

There's also an international frequency that's used for cases where someone is flying to close to a border or looks like they're going to cross the border.

My guess is Iran probably yelled over that frequency numerous times for the RPA to get out of the airspace, and the U.S. shrugged it's shoulders saying that they weren't trespassing.

We invaded Afghanistan because a Saudi living in Pakistan blew up some buildings.

We invaded Iraq because they supposedly had weapons of mass destruction, only for it to turn out that the whole thing was completely fabricated. 

Now we're supposed to believe an incredibly suspicious narrative that Iran decided to attack some oil tankers despite there being absolutely no reason for them to so and nothing for them to gain in the process?

9823	1561201068.0	"Hi there!

I'm curious, because there's a few different things in play here. UNCLOS defines 12 nautical miles off shore as home waters - but also an additional 12 nautical miles after that as a 'contiguous zone.' Now, I don't know sea law at all. I'm only interested because in a politics course, long ago, I was taught the territorial waters were defined as such because that's the furthest a cannon ball could reach. Which is funny. However, the contiguous zone is found in Part II, section 4, article 43 of UNCLOS. And allows for:

1. In a zone contiguous to its territorial sea, described as the contiguous zone, the coastal State may exercise the control necessary to: 

(a)   prevent  infringement  of  its  customs,  fiscal,  immigration  or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea

9848	1561188417.0	"In all likelihood, it was Iran who attacked all those oil tankers.  It's pretty widely accepted, even by countries that don't want any war taking place.  So whatever motive they had for that would presumably suffice as motive for this.  One motive could simply be this: the US left the nuclear deal and applied fairly strong sanctions on Iran.  Europe has stayed in the deal, but hasn't really done anything else.  So Iran is wondering why they are still complying with the deal while also feeling all this pain.  They want to be back at the bargaining table.  These provocations-- or at least the oil tankers, this is more ambiguous, though they still could have refrained from shooting the drone down even if it was briefly in their airspace-- could be designed to show that the current state of affairs is not sustainable and that Europe needs to reign everyone back in.  They want Europe and the US to come back to the table and deal with the sanctions.  They have no other course of action in their mind to deal with those sanctions than to act out.  They are counting, perhaps, on the fact that we are still in the post-Iraq haze, unable to commit fully to open warfare.  Even a US response would be ok in Iran's mind, because it wouldn't be all out war, it would be the sort of buildup that could precipitate talks.  The sort of attack being planned by the Trump administration wasn't an all out attack, it wasn't war.  And if Trump was trying to start a war, he would not have hesitated like he did.  I don't think Trump wants war, and I think Iran knows it.  Bolton's a load of trouble, but the most we've done is maybe fly a surveillance drone over Iranian waters, so for now at least, Trump's tendency to be critical of middle east wars is winning out.

Everyone is lieing about different parts of these building tensions.  Sorting it out is pretty tough considering neither regime has any credibility."	c3ealo	2019-06-22 09:26:57

I feel like Iran is looking for a reason to attack American forces in the area. Or that they understand that America has too much to lose in the region to start a war with them.

Iran has a standing army of around 535,000 troops, a band of militias that operate throughout the region, and a large supply of ballistic missiles. Not to mention, Iran would probably receive large military aid from Russia in the form of anti air weaponry that can down almost any jet or missile available in the U.S. arsenal.

Of course I am a total idiot, so I looked at some maps of the proposed routes and it is interesting that all of these countries are at or near war and happen to be strategic to the new silk road and would be most convenient for Saudi Arabia, especially considering their longer term economic forecasts (100-200 years and less global dependence on Oil).  Regardless of the proposed route, the actual route could go through these countries including Iran and India.

Instead both Oman and Iran are signatories of UNCLOS and thus international traffic lane goes through their territorial waters making a shipping lane of ""international"" status as per UNCLOS free navigation terms. As long as said navigation also adheres to UNCLOS terms. Kinda same as with Bosporus which is Turkish territory, but as per international treaties has an international right of way going through it. Again as per treaty terms, so just because there is international passage doesn't mean one gets to do whatever one likes and the territorial claim is not denounced. So both Iran and Oman still maintain their claims of their representative territorial waters and say ""innocent"" traffic is allowed through freely a managed lane. Lane being managed tightly more for navigation safety due to geography, rather than people being excluded from territorial waters, since as said everyone already is in territorial waters.

Both maintain foreign warships must ask permission to pass and will be allowed to pass if they heed to UNCLOSS freedom of navigation terms.

Every single action by Trump thus far has been like that of a toddler who has no clue what he's doing.

10162	1561172100.0	"No.  I'm implying that we should be more likely to start a war to protect our metal machines, which keep 350 million people safe, versus our soldiers, who are much less important to keeping 350 million people safe.  We only have dozens of drones, as you point out.  We have 1 million plus in the armed forces.  And the ability to get tens of millions more, if need be.  Soldiers are replaceable, in EXTREMELY high numbers, and quite quickly.  Drones are not.

>Face it, the US is looking for an excuse to start another regime change war, only this time some people are adept enough to realize it

I mean, they were just given pretty much every excuse in the world.  Even Germany agrees Iran was blowing up tankers.  That alone would be justification.  US obviously doesn't want war.  That's why it won't even strike Iran, when it has 10x more justification than with Iraq, or Afghanistan.

The USA is trying to use sanctions to strangle Iran, to prevent it from being an important ally to Russia/China, in the coming decades.  It's working.  The only way the USA can screw up, is to get sucked into a war, where it's perceived as the aggressor.  So, despite all of the things IRAN has done to try to start a war, in order to get USA to come to the table... the USA has been too scared to fire back.

In the end, Iran's plan likely worked.  Now Trump is trying to have unconditional negotiations with them, and America looks weaker than in recent memory."	c3ealo	2019-06-22 04:55:00

One example from the article, regarding the Mexican War:

>Polk sent an army into the disputed  territory and planted it directly across the Rio Grande from the dusty  little Mexican town of Matamoros, where a large number of Mexican troops  were stationed. This was highly incendiary, and it inevitably led to a  skirmish in which 11 American soldiers were killed and another 50 or so  captured. Polk promptly sent a message to Congress saying the United  States and Mexico were in a state of war and calling for a congressional  war declaration. 

&#x200B;

10212	1561184685.0	"Putting several assets in aggressive military positions while threatening a country with war is incendiary.  Even IF we are to take the Trump admin at their word on this, the US in NO WAY would tolerate what we expect our adversaries to tolerate.

Bolton and Pompeo have been openly advocating war with Iran for plenty long enough, and the US was the instigator by being the first to unilaterally withdraw from the nuclear deal, reimposing sanctions and threatening a sovereign nation with literally NO justification.  Iran is a terrible nation (with a surprisingly liberal youth population attempting to change things), but that doesn't mean that the US isn't CLEARLY the aggressor here.  Frankly, I'm shocked that Trump decided against striking and the only thing that makes sense, unless he suddenly grew a conscience, is that Russia talked him out of it due to their relationship."	c3ealo	2019-06-22 08:24:45

No what you are doing is missing the whole picture because you don't have a background in this. This wasn't Iran as a country that wanted this. This was the Ayatollah* using the IRGCN to do exactly what he wanted. Go look up the differences between the IRN and the IRGCN. It will help with your understanding of the Arabian Sea, Straits, and the GOO.

The US Military has long expected for this exact scenario to occur and is in fact one of our numerous and frequent training scenarios. Furthermore, Iran went right to the point of the mine and disarmed/removed it because they couldn't let it remain and be examined. Furthermore, these mines are standard fair for Iran. Furthermore, the blast patterns, fragmentation marks and remains, and style of use all match Iran's mines and their use of them.

Furthermore, many countries including Germany how come around to that point of view now that they have had a little bit of time to look at the intelligence on the attacks.

It was Iran. You may hate the US and that's your freedom to do so but don't start believing the IRGCN over the US.

It's easy to argue that these worked over the past 75 years having the advantage of hindsight, but I'd go further arguing that whenever the west has attempted to shift these policies for specific regions, the results were disastrous. And I'm not entirely pleased with the results when deterrence was the only tool used, either. 

Defensive posturing, only working with countries willing to cooperate is not enough to ensure peace. Deterrence is not believable when you don't show the ability to fight back. 

Also, for the record, when the first Iraq war started, their armed forces were the 4th in the world. It was well equipped and trained by soviet standards and employed a doctrine that the soviets would have employed in a conventional conflict against the west. And we had no reason at the time to assume that soviet equipment of the same generation was inferior to that of the US. 

They knew that they had no chance in a conventional warfare, but because the west has shown no interest to intervene before things escalate, they invaded Kuweit nonetheless. And they got bitchslapped for it. The point is that these strategies need to be used before major conflicts start, before it is obvious that interventions are needed.

That is just ridiculous, it's not 1846.

The information collection and investigation into something like this takes lots of time, and it deals with classified materials. The radar information is available, it will be released eventually. Hell, Iran may even release another DRAWING of the US violating their airspace.

Claiming to ""control"" the strait and asserting the ability to blockade or embargo it is fundamentally a repudiation of the notion that Iran's rights only extend to 12 nautical miles.  Iran has made it very clear over and over again that they consider their sphere of control to be well beyond that mark, through the entirety of the strait.

You need to read a little more history it seems. Rome, Britain, whenever a country is powerful enough to become a superpower with a wide reach, it creates things that allow that reach to solidify. It builds infrastructure so that it can trade with other powers, it protects trade routes because it makes money from trade, and if it has the largest economy, it's in the best position to do so. The reason the US put so much into rebuilding Europe after WW2 was specifically because otherwise, those nations would have fallen to Communism, it needed bulwarks against the Soviet Union and trading partners. No one is going to buy American goods or trade with America if they haven't the money or economy to do so. It's pragmatism, not altruism. 

Also, this is just a quibble, none of the countries you listed were fascist.

When the lifeblood of your economy (oil) is being sanctioned to death by the US and when you attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz and cause chaos throughout that region of the world in order to force the US into looking like the bad guys to garner some kind of support, that is an incentive. Iran generally believes that they can defeat the US in a war. That isn't unknown knowledge. Its an ideology conflict. They truly believe that they have god on their side and that it's their destiny to defeat whoever opposes them. Iran isn't dumb, they're just arrogant.

But because instead the Palastinians have no allies who care what happens to them, and because Israel is so useful to both the US and its own neighbors, the Palastinians are fucked.

And even that became a disadvantage when the allies began employing so-called ""meatgrinder"" tactics to take advantage of the DPRK/PRC's reliance on human-wave tactics and general aggression.

And yes, the drone loiters at 20km altitude, but it's surveillance capabilities are severely hampered. For advanced surveillance, the effective altitude is much lower, and so is the surveillance range.

 No, not at all. The Iran deal was signed by a president and Congress told Iran that is could easily change in the future.

The whole point of bashing Iran for not following it is that other countries do have an interest in keeping that line as the legal norm, and If Iran's claims becomes accepted globally, then the 12nm norm will be taking a step closer to no longer being a norm. Then what's the new norm? There is no agreement, so less stability and more conflict.

&#x200B;

Like what's going on here.

So it really doesn't matter if the US hasn't ratified it, because if it still follows it with regards to the 12nm legal limit, then that norm can survive.

&#x200B;

However to understand why this happening you need to understand the different types of economies are at play. China is a manufacturing economy and it is an excellent place to trade with for these items. They have absolutely mastered the process. For the US to apply tarrifs  is detrimental towards it's own pocketbook if you are looking at this from a short term perspective. The US on the other hand has a very strong services economy in which things like google, amazon, facebook etc operate. China ban's most of these from their country as well as steals IP from tech companies thus creating a massive trade imbalance. The time to address this was 20 years ago when it started happening, we are late and that's why it's so hard to change the ""norm"" of the current trade deficit. I'm not sure if tarrifs are the perfect answer, but asking politely hasn't changed shit.

&#x200B;

If you are referring to free trade in reference to the SOH starting to become a hot spot then that's a different discussion entirely. That revolves around safety of trade which is currently under threat(hint 6 tanker attacks in the last few months). If you think America is jumping the gun on accusing Iran, I can agree that is fair to say since we cannot just point a finger and go balls to wall without providing the proper evidence. Hence the drones patrolling the straights and the gulf of oman(in international waters) to have as much ISR coverage as possible to try and catch a tanker getting attacked or mines being deployed. This coverage has been literally shot down by Iran so now no one will have any way of collecting data if we simply just leave the area. In fact leaving the area would result in an even further destabilization of the region.

&#x200B;

My point is there really isn't any other power in that region what can play referee between the saudi's and Iran. I don't like saudis at all. In fact I really like Iran and I hope one day they are a regional power in the area, but right now if America just up and left(which I personally would love) it would be quite devastating to the rest of the world who get's their oil from the SOH. I'd get a big bag of popcorn and enjoy the show.

&#x200B;

To put it into perspective when the Filipino crew of the Japanese vessel were about to be rescued by Iran they declined and waited for the US to scoop them up. Iran in fact tried to impede this. Go figure the crew would rather be rescued by the US.

&#x200B;

I'd go into further detail about where I'm getting this information but to do so would violate operation security and as such you can take the last paragraph as a ""lie"" if you prefer. The rest is all in the news.

Iran is feeling strangled.  It's losing the ability to pay its proxies, because they're not getting the economic aid Europe promised.  So, they're acting out, to try to change the dynamic of the situation.  America is FINE if it continues like this... with Iran getting weaker with every passing day.  What America DOESN'T want is for the situation to change.  What Iran DOES want is for the situation to change.

That's why Iran is shooting down drones, and blowing up tankers... they're trying to change the situation.

11039	1561198080.0	"We are pretty much talking about the same concept. 


The missile always is capable of travelling the same distance against a target given the target's altitude is always the same and it flies in a straight line. In order words, the aerodynamic range of the missile is constant (it's sometimes described as the distance the missile can cover in a straight line before stalling at a given altitude, but that definition depends on who you ask as not all militaries use it).


As an example, if an aircraft is travelling at very high speed (let's say 1000kt) and a high altitude (let's say 40k feet) directly towards the system, the system can fire when the target is up to 70km away, and if the target continues to fly at a straight line, it will intercept it. Then you can claim the maximum range for a target with a closure rate of 1000kt at 40k feet is 70km. However, the missile itself covered much less distance than that, because the aircraft was also flying towards it. In this example, the maximum range far exceeds the aerodynamic range of the missile, but it can still make it.

If that target, however, was flying perpendicular to the SAM system, the distance the missile would have to cover would be much higher, because, in simple terms, the aircraft is not ""helping"" it by cutting the distance it has to travel by also travelling towards it. Therefore the target will need to be closer to the system for the missile to be able to reach it kinematically.

Even worse, if that target was flying _away_ from the SAM, then not only is not ""helping"" it by cutting the distance the missile has to fly, it's actively making it worse by _increasing_ that distance. Now, the aircraft has to be well _within_ the missile's aerodynamic range, because between the time the missile is fired and the time an interception happens, the aircraft has moved away from the SAM, and that distance was added to the distance the missile had to fly. In that case, if the aircraft was 20km away from the SAM system when it fired, and it was 30km away when the interception happened, the missile did not have to travel 20km, it had to travel 30km. In those conditions, the maximum range of the system was below the aerodynamic range of the missile, because even though the aircraft was 20km away when it fired, the missile had to travel 30.


What countries usually do is producing a test like the first example, and then they throw the ""70km"" number with no context, where in reality the conditions were extremely favorable to produce a high number, and in different conditions, that number might not be as high. It's pretty much a PR number, and the true aerodynamic range of missiles and so on is kept confidential.

>The intercept vehicle would be subject to the same atmospheric conditions regardless of the orientation of the target.

Iran was invited into Syria by one of its remaining allies, the Assad regime, who has very little legitimacy left.  Assad is a brutal dictator who was committing atrocities well before the war.  He tortured political prisoners in basement dungeons, and attempted to completely wipe out all traces of Kurdish identity in the country.  Being a recognized government says nothing whatsoever about the morality of that government, so being invited by them to kill its own citizens is hardly better than the US coming into Iraq to kill Iraq's in order to remove a brutal dictator that is the recognized government.

Assad is a brutal dictator. However the torture he did was often contracted by the US. Once the US and Saudi Arabia backed the radical jihadi elements of the opposition, it became clear that if Assad fell, whatever replaced him would be much worse, especially for the Kurdish and Alawite minorities.

Hezbollah is essentially the Lebanese army and a part of the government as a recognized political party. They were formed to fight the illegal Israeli occupation of Lebanon. That’s a far more noble origin than the groups the US was backing in Syria.

It's not because the USA is suddenly moral.  It's because it's in the USA's best interest to let Iran hurt its international image, which will probably force Europe to join the USA in sanctioning Iran.

If Iran really does leave the nuclear treaty, like they say they're going to do... Europe will no longer help them out, and will go back to sanctioning them, which will probably cause Iran to fall."	c3ealo	2019-06-22 06:36:09

> In April 1959 Iran altered the legal status of the strait by expanding its territorial sea to 12 nautical miles (22 km) and declaring that it would recognize only transit by innocent passage through the newly expanded area.[3] In July 1972, Oman also expanded its territorial sea to 12 nautical miles (22 km) by decree.[3] Thus, by mid-1972, the Strait of Hormuz was completely ""closed"" by the combined territorial waters of Iran and Oman. During the 1970s, neither Iran or Oman attempted to impede the passage of warships through the strait, but in the 1980s, both countries asserted claims that were different from customary (old) law. Upon ratifying UNCLOS in August 1989, Oman submitted declarations confirming its 1981 royal decree that only innocent passage is permitted through its territorial sea. The declarations further asserted that prior permission was required before foreign warships could pass through Omani territorial waters.[3] Upon signing the convention in December 1982, Iran entered a declaration stating “that only states parties to the Law of the Sea Convention shall be entitled to benefit from the contractual rights created therein”, including “the right of transit passage through straits used for international navigation”. In May 1993, Iran enacted a comprehensive law on maritime areas, several provisions of which conflict with UNCLOS provisions, including a requirement that warships, submarines, and nuclear-powered ships obtain permission before exercising innocent passage through Iran’s territorial waters.The United States does not recognize any of the claims by Oman and Iran and has contested each of them

Your mistake is in assuming _that_ number is the publicized PR propaganda number you see in wikipedia or in advertisement brochures. It is not, because any military keeps that number secret. The public numbers you will always see posted is the range to the target upon firing, not the distance to the intercept point, and on top of that, the conditions of the target for that particular shot are almost always kept secret.

Yes they are free to construct as many islands as they want, but that's not the problem. The problem is that China is trying to use the islands to claim territorial waters that are well within the territorial waters of other countries.

No one cares about artificial islands made by Qatar or the United Arab Emirates because they are not using them to get more territorial waters.

That is complete nonsense.  Published engagement ranges may certainly be inaccurate, but they will *always* reference the distance to a potential intercept point.  Detection and tracking distances are what govern target firing, and those are always considerably larger than engagement ranges precisely because you need to identify and launch before the target reaches the engagement range if it is approaching the platform.

The Trump administration has been wrong and has lied about a ton of other things.  But have been truthful about some things.  This is always the case.  To think, well if the US propaganda machine says one thing, then that must be a lie, is just foolish.  I agree, *always* be skeptical of what they say, regardless of who is in office, but it's cool aid of a different brand to immediately filter all news like this through a filter and assume the military industrial complex is behind the scenes rubbing their greedy hands together while pulling all the strings.  The world is too damn complex to have those sorts of mental shortcuts.  Think for yourself. 

Even Chomsky, I bet, would say something like, yes, it appears that Iran committed those attacks, but it was the US who created those conditions by pulling out of the nuclear deal and applying brutal sanctions on the people of Iran, and then he would go on for 5 or 10 minutes about the US's imperialism in the Middle East.

It was traditionally a principle of international law that has gradually given way in modern times until its proscription after World War II when the crime of war of aggression was first codified in the Nuremberg Principles. 

The might makes right mentality was far stronger in the early 20th century then it is now. Institutions that the US helped set up like the UN made declaring war more difficult (unless it was in self-defense or with a UN Security Council authorization).

No style of imperialism is humane, it relies on the exploitation of poorer people around the world. The only reason America didn't want European countries to retain their colonies was so they could become prospective markets in our ""free-trade"" system.

European countries traded European colonists finished products for raw material. None of that wealth actually flowed to the locals who were enslaved to do the actual work. Any locals that actually benefitted were collaborators.

The difference is we allow locals to virtually enslave themselves. Chinese capitalists now take advantage of chinese laborers. Indian elites now take advantage of poor indians. Where as in before you would have European colonists on site. 

> No style of imperialism is humane, it relies on the exploitation of poorer people around the world. 

Prior to european imperalism, the elites of aboriginal societies exploit their poor, with imperalism they all get exploited by europeans. To the actual poor people,  not much changed expect the man yelling at you is now a foreigner. 

With american style imperalism we went back to local elites exploiting their poor. Youre right in the fact that it is still inhumane but it helps rich white people sleep better at night. Just like Nike executives can say they dont use slave labor by contracting out to suppliers who do use slave labor.

Israel doesn't want war. It wants Iran deterred. A war between the US and Iran will trigger a war between Israel and Iran + its proxies. Hezbollah is the strongest non-state actor in the world, it's an organization that is anti-thetical in military doctrine to the disgraces of what were decades ago the armies of Egypt and Syria, and a war with them now, in 2019, when they are stronger than ever with a stockpile of over 100,000 missiles that are capable of hitting any target in Israel and beyond, will take a huge toll on Israel. It will come at a price that Israel doesn't want to pay, even if it can theoretically defeat Hezbollah. Hezbollah doesn't want a war either. It knows that in the case of a war, Israel will not act with the restraint it acted with in the last skirmishes in Gaza, but it will simply level the entire country.

Spreading their influence to places like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. They provide training, equipment, and financial aid to those who share the same goals and ideology. Gaining a larger foothold in the region giving them more power. At this point the best thing to do would be to support the people of Iran if they choose to rise up.

Iran's muslim government was put in power by the US and the UK.70 years ago Iran was a nonreligious country, no head scarfs, no bullshit muslim laws.  If you were in Iran back then, you would have thought you were in France or other European countries.     .Iranians call themselves Persian, not Iranian.The Persian empire was one of the great historic empires that had technology, math, and science.    They had indoor plumbing, bridges, tall buildings, irrigation canals, they invented batteries to use electricity to plate objects with gold, mining technology, windmills to pump water, and even women's rights.  The Persian culture treats women as equals with men.

Now most Iranians, especially the below 50 generation, are not even religious at all.There are many cities that are basically agnostic.The people in Iran are some of the most generous, educated, and friendly people in the world.  Almost everyone in Iran has illegal satellite dishes so they watch US and EU TV.  When the government removes dishes from roofs, the people put up a new dish the next day.  Even with the shitty religious government, Iran is one of the safest countries to live in.  Foreigners only get arrested if the religious government can use them for bargaining or because they did something really stupid.  Iran loves visitors who spend money and they treat visitors like they would treat their mom or dad.Iran even has some of the best colleges in the world, along with a huge modern manufacturing sector.

&#x200B;

And like 99% of Iranians hate their government.But Iran's government fights terrorism like Isis, so they are really an ally of the US.    They are against Saudis who were behind 9/11.When you see Iranians burning flags and hating on Americans, they are not from the 99%.  They are the 1% doing it because they are paid to do it or because they are religious nut jobs that no one likes.  Basically the Iranian flag burners are the equivalent of wacko religious republicans in the US.

Really the US and UK screwed the people of Iran by getting rid of Iran's non-religious government.    The US and UK now have a duty of the Iranian people to help get rid of their religious government.  Iranians really, really hate their government and stupid religious bullshit.   It is so common that their religious police basically does very little since no one will listen to them.Also, everyone in Iran drinks alcohol even though it is forbidden.

Outside of public spaces women never wear a head scarf.

You should not hate Iran, but you should hate Iran's government.  Many of their citizens do too.  They aren't uneducated right wing bumpkins fawning over their government (e.g. they are not Alabama); for the most part they are an enlightened, educated collection of people who, if given the choice, would live under a very different style of government.

That does NOT mean that the US should intervene in anyway.  Iran is not Iraq.  Iraq was bad enough, but war with Iran would be a different story entirely.

Not only do they have a powerful army, and allies (e.g. Russia) who would back them in a land war, but war with Iran would almost certainly lead to attacks on American soil, which would force the US government to get even more involved in Iran, and then force more attacks on American soil, ad infinitum.

Iran backs government forces in Syria and is pretty obvious with this support.  Saudi Arabia backed rebels that operated in the south of the country (MbS was in direct command of the Damascus offensive in 2013 if you believe Wikileaks).  The SAA defeated them but shipped the surviving rebels to Idlib province, where there is currently an active offensive taking place.  I don't know if the Saudis are still supporting them, but the rebels are pretty well-armed (this may have more to do with Turkey than anything else).

I don't follow Yemen closely but I'd infer that the tanker attack had something to do with the Yemeni Civil War (if Iran actually is responsible).  Yemen has become a 3-sided war with Iranian interests being based in Sanaa (the original capital), UAE interests being based in Aden (largest port city), and Saudi Arabia backing Al Qaeda and other extremist Sunni elements in the same manner that they do everywhere else.

I also think you're overvaluing how much power Iran gets from nuclear weapons.  The only thing that does is put them on equal footing with Israel.

Iran would have money and oil too if it was allowed to trade with the rest of the world. The sanctions are the main difference between them and the Saudis.

Obama saw that and he saw ideally if there's a chance for the US to normalize relations with Iran they should take it. He even had some nice deals lined up with Iran when the sanctions were lifted, like an Iranian order for Boeing airliners.

But traditionally American warhawks need at least one or two designated permanent enemies, even if those countries could be made friends or at least business partners instead. So the deal had to go.

There's a reason that the majority of the population is starving since the Saudi's began blocking access to ports.



The Saudi coalition [even admitted they bombed a runway to make it unusable for a Iranian plane to land to deliver aid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/28/aid-flights-to-yemen-blocked-after-saudi-arabia-bombs-airport-runway). They've also been massively delaying the aid that they do let through [for months causing even more unnecessary deaths](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-yemen-aid-delay-killing-children-save-the-children-warn-a7606411.html)



Saudi Arabia has also [threatened to attack aid organisations if they remained in regions controlled by the Houthis, a blatant violation of international law and the protections given to aid and medical workers in war zones](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/02/17/yemen-saudi-warnings-no-free-pass-attack)

Saudi Arabia has also used cluster bombs, known for their high risk to civilian life in Yemen (boy, I wonder why the peace loving and caring Saudi government would do that if they're worried about civilian casualties)


Want me to go on explaining why the Saudi's are scum?"	bq4izl	2019-05-19 16:16:11
