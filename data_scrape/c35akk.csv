Take that with a grain of salt because it's a tweet and all, but from everything I've read on this I actually thinks that's the truth. One thing I will say about Trump when it comes to the military, regardless of what you're opinion is on his stated policies, when he puts those policies in place he seems to tell the military leaders who would be in charge in those specific situations to do whatever they want. The dropping of the MOAB bomb on that massive terrorist cave for example, reports said military leaders told the president ""this is what we want to do"" and trump told them to do whatever they think is necessary. In other words, I don't think he's deeply involved in the actual specifics of military operations. I don't want to turn this into a conversation of if that line of decision making is a good thing or not, but I'm guessing this was a similar situation. President is briefed on the drone being shot down, some people in the military wan't to retaliate and he tells them to do you thing. My guess is then that as they talked to more people he's pressed to ask more details on it and makes the decision that this isn't a good response for whatever reason, be it that it truly hurts some moral conscious with the loss of life to just a simple ""it will create a bad 24 hour news cycle and hurt your poll numbers by X%"" kind of decision.  



Regardless of all that, I’m more concerned, as a matter of national security, that an approved strike was somehow leaked to the media at all. Sure it was called off but it was leaked, along with INTENDED TARGETS. I don't care what side of the isle you are on politically, but this is very specifically not the kind of shit you wan't leaked out. I'm sure those intended targets weren't just pulled out of our ass, it was probably the work of hundreds of analysts who work day and night to monitor our geopolitical foes to have action plans ready for situations like this. All that work they did is probably now gone out the window. The fact that there are individuals who leak this shit because they more than likely have a gripe with the current president should be concerning to everyone one. 

Imagine if say the raid that killed Bin laden was called off by President Obama at the last minute because they were worried about collateral deaths of innocent civilians. Then within 24 hours someone inside some department or military branch who didn't like President Obama leaks all the specific details of the Raid including the location to a media outlet that's on the other side of the isle like say Fox cable news channel.  And that ""journalist"" without a care about what the impacts of this infromation might cause rushes to print something because of their constant Anti-Obama narrative. I think Reddit would be up in arms about it. 

You can't be intellectually honest and say a huge portion of the media is vehemently anti-Trump. Again, not trying to have a conversation about if that's right or wrong, and they have every right to criticize him on the shit he does and publish whatever they want on his day to day antics. But, the fact that they would publish this type of story that might legitimately threatens our national security (and to be fair the right wing outlets were all over this story as well) and the fact that it was likely leaked by someone who personally disagrees with their commander in chief is just flat out wrong. 

These kind of leaks go beyond whistle blowing legitimate unconstitutional and horribly immoral/corrupt things our politicians might be doing and trying to hide from us. This isn't leaks from concerned citizens like say the Contra program that sparks a deep investigative journalism operation that reveals to the public the evils of certain actions. This is dangerous shit and we should be worried. The Military needs to be able to operate, and the President, regardless of whatever circus animal they currently are, needs to be able to work with them in an efficient manner. And I'm not buying the narrative some on the right are saying that this was some 4-D chess move to scare the Iranians. We don't need to scare them, if we wanted to we could basically end their existence as a functioning military and government in a matter of days or weeks. Their military becomes a pure ground force with mostly small arms with little to no higher tier weaponry as the Air force, Armored Division, and Navy would be wiped out from strike launched safely from hundreds if not thousands of miles away, and Irans beyond the horizon retaliation capabilities are laughable compared to what the united states is capable of."	c35akk	2019-06-22 02:49:58

53	1561121604.0	So Trump backs out of Nuclear agreement with Iran. Then begins threats. Let's remember this is all about destroying Obama's legacy for the night at the White House press club before he became president. Then without any real solid evidence accuses Iran of bombing a Japanese and Norwegian tanker just as the Japanese prime minister happened to be in Iran. America then proceeds to possibly fly a drone over Iranian airspace with its beacon off (possibly suspicious) and gets shot down. To which Trump decides it's time to initiate war only to be held back at the last minute.

#FIRST HALF (was over max character limit)

-------------------

WASHINGTON — President Trump approved military strikes against Iran in retaliation for downing an American surveillance drone, but pulled back from launching them on Thursday night after a day of escalating tensions.

As late as 7 p.m., military and diplomatic officials were expecting a strike, after intense discussions and debate at the White House among the president’s top national security officials and congressional leaders, according to multiple senior administration officials involved in or briefed on the deliberations.

Officials said the president had initially approved attacks on a handful of Iranian targets, like radar and missile batteries.

The operation was underway in its early stages when it was called off, a senior administration official said. Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down, the official said.

[For Mr. Trump, “judgment time is coming” on how to respond to Iran.]

The abrupt reversal put a halt to what would have been the president’s third military action against targets in the Middle East. Mr. Trump had struck twice at targets in Syria, in 2017 and 2018.

It was not clear whether Mr. Trump simply changed his mind on the strikes or whether the administration altered course because of logistics or strategy. It was also not clear whether the attacks might still go forward.

Asked about the plans for a strike and the decision to hold back, the White House declined to comment, as did Pentagon officials. No government officials asked The New York Times to withhold the article.

The retaliation plan was intended as a response to the shooting down of the unmanned, $130 million surveillance drone, which was struck Thursday morning by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, according to a senior administration official who was briefed on the military planning and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential plans.

The strike was set to take place just before dawn Friday in Iran to minimize risk to the Iranian military and civilians.

But military officials received word a short time later that the strike was off, at least temporarily.

The possibility of a retaliatory strike hung over Washington for much of the day. Officials in both countries traded accusations about the location of the drone when it was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile launched from the Iranian coast along the Gulf of Oman.

Mr. Trump’s national security advisers split about whether to respond militarily. Senior administration officials said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; John R. Bolton, the national security adviser; and Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, had favored a military response. But top Pentagon officials cautioned that such an action could result in a spiraling escalation with risks for American forces in the region.

Congressional leaders were briefed by administration officials in the Situation Room.

The destruction of the drone underscored the already tense relations between the two countries after Mr. Trump’s recent accusations that Iran is to blame for explosions last week that damaged oil tankers traveling through the strait, the vital waterway for much of the world’s oil. Iran has denied that accusation.

Iran’s announcement this week that it would soon breach one of the key limits it had agreed to in a 2015 pact intended to limit its nuclear program has also fueled tensions. Mr. Trump, who pulled the United States out of the 2015 pact, has vowed that he will not allow Tehran to build a nuclear weapon.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump insisted that the United States’ unmanned surveillance aircraft was flying over international waters when it was taken down by an Iranian missile.

“This drone was in international waters, clearly,” the president told reporters on Thursday afternoon at the White House as he began a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. “We have it all documented. It’s documented scientifically, not just words.”

Asked what would come next, Mr. Trump said, “Let’s see what happens.”

Iran’s government fiercely disputed the president’s characterization, insisting that the American drone had strayed into Iranian airspace. Iran released GPS coordinates that put the drone eight miles off the country’s coast, inside the 12 nautical miles from the shore that Iran claims as its territorial waters.

Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, wrote in a letter to the Security Council that the drone ignored repeated radio warnings before it was downed. He said that Tehran “does not seek war” but “is determined to vigorously defend its land, sea and air.”

Congressional Democrats emerged from the president’s classified briefing in the Situation Room and urged Mr. Trump to de-escalate the situation. They called on the president to seek congressional authorization before taking any military action.

“This is a dangerous situation,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “We are dealing with a country that is a bad actor in the region. We have no illusions about Iran in terms of their ballistic missile transfers, about who they support in the region and the rest.”

Iran’s destruction of the drone appeared to provide a boost for officials inside the Trump administration who have long argued for a more confrontational approach to Iran, including the possibility of military actions that could punish the regime for its support of terrorism and other destabilizing behavior in the region.

The U.S. Says Iran Attacked Tankers. Does the Evidence Add Up?

But in his public appearance, Mr. Trump initially seemed to be looking for a way to avoid a potentially serious military crisis. Instead of directly accusing the leaders of Iran, Mr. Trump said someone “loose and stupid” in Iran was responsible for shooting down the drone.

The president said he suspected it was some individual in Iran who “made a big mistake,” even as Iran had taken responsibility for the strike and asserted that the high-altitude American drone was operating over Iranian air space, which American officials denied.

Mr. Trump said the episode would have been far more serious if the aircraft had been a piloted vehicle, and not a drone. It made “a big, big difference” that an American pilot was not threatened, he told reporters.

Last year, Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran, over the objections of China, Russia and American allies in Europe. He has also imposed punishing economic sanctions on Iran, trying to cut off its already limited access to international trade, including oil sales.

Iran has warned of serious consequences if Europe does not find a way around those sanctions, though it has denied involvement in the attacks on tankers near the vital Strait of Hormuz. On Monday, Iran said it would soon stop abiding by a central component of the nuclear deal, the limit on how much enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile.

Both Washington and Tehran said the downing of the drone occurred at 4:05 a.m. Thursday in Iran, or 7:35 p.m. Wednesday in Washington. The drone “was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while operating in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz,” the United States Central Command said in a statement. “This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset in international airspace.”

Iran’s ability to target and destroy the high-altitude American drone, which was developed to evade the very surface-to-air missiles used to bring it down, surprised some Defense Department officials, who interpreted it as a show of how difficult Tehran can make things for the United States as it deploys more troops and steps up surveillance in the region."	c35akk	2019-06-21 16:34:32

The tables turned. Now it's working on us. 

Brezhnev paved the way for Gorbachev, Now Trump is paving the way for a softer U.S. response. Very possibly a worse predecessor. I can't even imagine...

A hard liner, like Putin, apparently learned from our tactics. We got greedy and forceful since ""winning"" the cold war. Containment worked, now we're being contained with infighting.

The cold war is still going. It never ended. The focus just shifted to us to lead the way and we got so over confident with that power, we didn't realize it happened. Then Donny boy got himself a Russian backer, took the express elevator to the top, piled us all in and pressed the button to a proverbial hell. 

Enjoy the ride. This is one sadistic sine wave. Unless we all start pulling together, we will stay on it until a proxy war turns into an escalation nuke fight.

 We're split because we're too busy fighting over petty differences and blaming each other for this administration.  Everybody voted for who they wanted, that's how the system works.

345	1561139027.0	Seems like a classic pre-election stunt by a U.S. president. Going to war creates a fear in the American people to rally behind the flag and increase nationalist feelings. This would certainly help trump get the votes. George W. Bush did the same in 2003, when his entourage (Collin Powell & Condoleezza Rice) accused Saddam Hussein of having nuclear weapons. The UN said he had no weapons. Germany said he had no weapons. Tony Blair (UK Prime Minister back then) was forced to rally behind the U.S., because it’s their closest ally. Nobody else wanted to go to war with Iraq. It created a mess. The U.S. has often used military action to maintain its hegemonic position and will continue to do so until a new super power will kick their ass.

360	1561142655.0	"It is ridiculous that a military strike was even considered in retaliation for the downing of a drone. The entire purpose of using drones to conduct surveillance operations is that they are expendable, containing no human pilot, therefore requiring no grief at their passing, or vengeance if they are destroyed. Furthermore, the probability that the drone was both in the Straight of Hormuz, between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, AND not in Iranian airspace when it was felled, is minimal.

A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the ""Clean Break"" report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by Richard Perle for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on ""Western values."" It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting its possession of ""weapons of mass destruction"". Certain parts of the policies set forth in the paper were rejected by Netanyahu.[2][3]

https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm

In the days after September 11, Mr Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, mounted an attempt to include Iraq in the war against terror. When the established agencies came up with nothing concrete to link Iraq and al-Qaida, the OSP was given the task of looking more carefully.

""None of the Israelis who came were cleared into the Pentagon through normal channels,"" said one source familiar with the visits. Instead, they were waved in on Mr Feith's authority without having to fill in the usual forms.

TThe exchange of information continued a long-standing relationship Mr Feith and other Washington neo-conservatives had with Israel's Likud party.

The Israeli influence was revealed most clearly by a story floated by unnamed senior US officials in the American press, suggesting the reason that no banned weapons had been found in Iraq was that they had been smuggled into Syria. Intelligence sources say that the story came from the office of the Israeli prime minister.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/08/sheldon-adelson-trump-middle-east-policy

Adelson, who is seventy-four, owns two of Las Vegas’s giant casino resorts, the Venetian and the Palazzo, and is the third-richest person in the United States, according to Forbes. He is fiercely opposed to a two-state solution; and he had contributed so generously to Bush’s reëlection campaign that he qualified as a Bush Pioneer. A short, rotund man, with sparse reddish hair and a pale countenance that colors when he is angered, Adelson protested to Bush that Rice was thinking of her legacy, not the President’s, and that she would ruin him if she continued to pursue this disastrous course. Then, as Adelson later told an acquaintance, Bush put one arm around his shoulder and another around that of his wife, Miriam, who was born in Israel, and said to her, “You tell your Prime Minister that I need to know what’s right for your people—because at the end of the day it’s going to be my policy, not Condi’s. But I can’t be more Catholic than the Pope.”

448	1561135138.0	Here’s what it is. Donald Trump is not a Republican. He is not Democrat. His goal is to divide. He finds contention between right and left, rich and poor, science and religion, etc and then he exploits it for his own personal gain. He is an egomaniac who loves that we are focused on what he tweets about. He doesn’t care about consequences because he believes his money will protect him from ever having to deal with them. Every American wants America to be greater than its ever been.. we always had potential to be better... we dont need to backtrack unless of course we are owning up to our past mistakes and making every effort not to repeat the tarnished reputation we’ve created for ourselves. Trump is using us to distract ourselves from moving on... from truly being great!	c35akk	2019-06-21 18:38:58

His indecisiveness will end in disaster. Approving the strike in the first place was bad enough, but calling it off mid-air just makes everything a mess. 

This entire situation is needless. What did this half-sentient boob expect would happen when he nixed the Iran deal and goaded them endlessly while putting frothing mindless hawks like Bolton on his cabinet?

I'd bet money his decision to pull out of the strikes was because of Ingraham's warnings. They've spoken directly to him before as they know he watches Fox religiously.

Perhaps we wait for more intel before retaliation. But sanctions seem to be working somewhat with Iran, extra sanctions might be more effective than blowing some of their shit up.

But of course Iran is the aggressor. 

Meanwhile  US' second best buddy is Saudi Arabia, a regime that routinely behead, torture and crucify protesters on a regular basis, support terrorism , has been actively spreading violent Wahabism all over the globe for decades now, has been involved in 9/11, and is committing countless atrocities in yemen.

&#x200B;

Its pretty clear at this point that Trump doesn't want a war with Iran. Rather its gotten to a point of brinkmanship between the 2. Who will blink first.

&#x200B;

Trump was hoping the hostile rhetoric would get Iran to choose to negotiate without preconditions like North Korea, they chose not to and are instead engaging in a series of micro escalations to test Trump into agreeing to their own pre-conditions before negotiations (loosening sanctions). Now he doesn't know what to do next and things are moving closer to conflict. He's hoping he can scare Iran into negotiations, or otherwise be handed a solid casus belli that can galvanize Americans to war without damaging his political prospects. If Iran continues with attacking foreign ships he can just choose not to respond, but if they continue to attack American assets in the straits without response he will look weaker and weaker domestically (and frankly internationally). If dead Americans result he can possibly galvanize the population to war, and Iran is aware of that, so it is taking care (so far at least) to either attack foreign ships or unmanned US assets.

&#x200B;

 Trumps constant lying, alienating allies, and the ghost of Iraq leave Trump with no international sympathy or credibility. He would love it if the rest of the world would strengthen sanctions on Iran to get them to the table, but he simply doesn't have the clout. Iran see's this, its calculus with Trump's aversion to full war and the global distrust of him is that it can get away with these micro-escalations without the US going to war or wide international condemnation by spreading doubt, perhaps causing the US to blink first and lower sanctions in return for them negotiating. Alternatively, if Trump doesn't move and they face no condemnation, they can back out of the deal themselves with the gamble that Trump will be unable to cobble together another coalition to sanction it again (not a bad bet).

&#x200B;

At that point its a true gamble and the next action is purely in Trump's court.

&#x200B;

 Will he pointlessly flail about with tactical strikes that will be retaliated against with no appreciable prevention of Iranian breakout capability?, give in and lower sanctions in return for negotiations, possibly with Iran either again temporarily halting enrichment in return for lowering sanctions, or otherwise continue enriching during negotiations (the latter would be an extreme display of weakness on Trump's part!) Or will he bite the bullet and do something major without the requisite casus belli, which will lead to American deaths, American criticism, and likely a failed election.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Someone has to blink first, and if Trump does it he's gonna look very weak right in time for the election cycle.

&#x200B;

If negotiations don't begin, I'd expect another attack in the straits in the next few weeks. How long until Iran begins enrichment activities again? Maybe that will be the action."	c35akk	2019-06-21 16:23:24

we will bring peace (because the united states will never attack if we defend Iran).

and there, all the Arab countries (and more) will love us.

On 3 July 1988, a sophisticated US Navy warship, the USS Vincennes, shot down an Iranian civilian airliner flying over the Persian Gulf.
All 290 on board the aircraft were killed, among them 66 children.
Rudy Pahoyo was a Navy Combat Cameraman who was filming on board the USS Vincennes that day.

What a farce. Every single American citizen is idly sitting by while Trump and the hierarchical right-wing representatives of America's industrial military complex prepare to re-ignite conflict in order to ensure a predictably lucrative expansion of America's military power and presence internationally.

Too many elected legislators pursue personal wealth at any cost, over the responsibilities entrusted to them on behalf of your citizens. Representatives should never accept finances in exchange for abandoning the majority of their constituents' political wills or requirements of said officials. Yet, this happens all the time. It's happening as I write this. 

The power in America should rest with the people. That power should be used for the betterment of the people. Those people should act for and empower one another through reasonable and predictable representation in the executive and legislative branches of government.

If those people refuse to represent you, act in your favour, and improve your lives... then they need to be removed. Your constitutional protections and obligations towards one another only function in the spirit of your constitution if your representatives are representative - they're not. 

Chief among these is unfortunately the 'man' with the most-numerously afforded powers in the executive government. Donald Trump is the single-least representative elected official in the history of your spineless country. The constitutional powers and protections granted to this cunt are meant to empower him to executively represent your ideological will. However, the symptoms of institutionalized unrepresentative officials have created a myriad of impediments for the majority of voters to demand representative decisions from the executive branch while simultaneously empowering the Presidency with the authority to ignore any legal or civil expectations from the legislative body or the people. Individual American citizens are supposed to have the power to decide who the President is, and grant power to that individual to protect and represent them. 

America meets none of the three default requirements of a Democracy. You do not have equality and you never have. You are not equal under the law and you never have been. You do not have free and fair elections, and you never will have them again unless someone puts a bullet in Trump's fat fake head and reveals his skull is completely empty. He is deliberately deconstructing the institutional protections of your citizens by; eroding public services, constitutional rights of women, sensationalizing and protecting white-nationalists, deconstructing government agencies that exist to protect the environment and the working class, and I don't have enough blood to boil to continue explaining this. Someone, anyone, needs to walk up to that belligerent troll-doll daughter-fucking maniac and shoot him in the head. 

When Bolton and Trump get the conflict they want in Iran, they're going to ensure those killed are disparately poor coloured liberal-votes. It's okay though. Just sit in your fucking chair and pretend like the fabric of your society isn't being eroded by a guy who couldn't survive an attempt on his life if it was done with a pool noodle and a paper clip.

1209	1561138225.0	"Iran is undoubtedly a terrorist regime but the problem is that you cannot address that if you decide to fight a war on all fronts.   Trump is fighting battles with everyone at the moment including his allies.  That's the real problem with his rhetoric and tariffs.  He has alienated so many other countries that gathering support at the United Nations is very difficult.  I'm really not sure that there would be any support at all for any intervention by the USA against Iran.  Many have no option when it comes to economic measures against Iran but any military action would have very little support world wide.  Imagine if Iran brought down a US passenger plane, the normal indignation and support for the USA would not be as it once was and should be at the UN.  Countries like China who would have otherwise minded their own business but would now be less than supportive.  To take on any enemy you need friends, you need those who don't take sides against you and you need those who will only use words and condemnation and nothing more.  Trump is fighting so many unnecessary wars that he risks have little support from friends who themselves will be condemned internally if they support Trump.

The attacks on tankers are viewed with suspicion and mistrust in Europe many wonder if the Saudis or even US are orchestrating a false flag campaign against Iran.  I do not believe that is a good sign as it demonstrates US standing in the world right now.  These warnings were given to Trump and his advisors, your rhetoric and actions run the risk of ruining the global standing of the US in the world and a nation build on defending the values of democracy, freedom and liberty.   We are seeing now what happens when you place such responsibility in the hands of an idiot and a lunatic who thinks his presidency is merely and extension of the apprentice, it all part of 'the spectacle' he says fake news so many times because he is now psychologically processed to live his life in the show.  So he is in his own twilight zone munching his burgers and sipping his Diet Coke with a finger hovering over the self destruct button that will take us all out and what option do we have when a congress is afraid of the power of the nutters who voted for him.  A Democratic Party who would rather try to weave a path to power than uphold the authority entrusted to them by the sound of mind who just want normality.   The lunatics have indeed finally taken over the asylum."	c35akk	2019-06-21 19:30:25

Since we're in wild speculation mode, here's mine. What if Bolton essentially set the whole operation in place because Trump outsourced this to him weeks ago, and Trump was essentially blindsided by the fact that bombers were about to launch.

It's not though. 

I don't want a conflict any more than any sane adult, but this just sends mixed signals to Iran. They shot a drone down and the reaction was ""we're gonna hit you! ... But actually no"". How is Iran supposed to take that? Should they push more? Does it mean the US isn't going to do anything? Should they escalate? 

I think in this situation, a couple of commensurate missile strikes would send the signal that there's a line and you don't want to cross it. I think it would actually helped defuse tensions because you now have boundaries.

Iran agreed to a deal and the US and others and kept by it and now the US finds itself in a fight with a cornered animal it doesn't have the appetite or ability to counter. This is fully Trumps shitty foreign policy biting him in the ass. What is the US gonna do? Invade Iran? Fucking laughable. Start bombing them? Wouldn't do anything, and probably increase Iranian involvement in Iraq, Syria, Yemen etc. None of which trump wants to get involved in.

This will give the US more room to demonstrate what a massive threat Iran is, satellite photos of increased military activity, missiles being moved into positions closer to US troops, to justify the action that's coming.

The smart move right now for Iran \*is\* to stand down. Make a massive statement at the UN about how they're not going to get dragged into a war over nothing, that they trust the US not to attack a country that is not prepared for it, and to not step up their military preparedness.

It'll sell well during election season if he seemed initially reluctant.

Now, this. This was a message, but also good PR for Trump that plays both angles-- he was ready to bomb, but then he decided against it, and let EVERYONE know all about it. This is scary stuff. I only see it escalating from here. The war contractors are hungry, and since free speech and visibility into gov. diminish during wartime, it's their best bet to take total control of the country."	c35akk	2019-06-21 23:36:25

Now, of course the NYTimes isn't exactly quaking in their boots, because [in the article they note no agency cited any security concerns prior to its publication](https://twitter.com/NYTimesPR/status/1140091848255578112).

I think the Times is going to prominently feature a block of text noting this in every single article like this just so they can say “did you even read the whole thing, Mr. President, or are you just going off half-cocked and talking out your ass?”"	c35akk	2019-06-22 00:21:09

1384	1561160811.0	I'm legitimately confused. I thought that there would be a meeting in the Situation Room where the Generals and military officials would present the response options/plans, giving the President a briefing on the details for each mission (including anticipated casualty counts), and then receive a decision as to which option was approved from the President directly. If that's the case, then the President would have already known that lives were at risk, and have approved the proportionality. But now he says that, 10 minutes before the strike was launched, he just happened to ask about the number of possible casualties and then retracted his approval. That means 1. the military officials screwed up royally and forgot to include that information in the brief; 2. the President wasn't paying attention or missed that information when it was given to him initially; 3. the brief didn't happen but approval was given anyway (possibly by someone other than Trump, though I don't see how the military would permit that); 4. the President was briefed, knew the casualty count, and forgot or changed his mind (I would be perfectly ok with just changing his mind, but that is not what he is implying, he acts like he never knew in the first place); 5. the President is LYING to us (oh the horror) and knew all along, but retracted his approval for another reason, possibly as planned. If its that last one, then the administration used the United States military as a political prop to escalate tensions with Iran and garner more votes for the re-election campaign. It would have to have been without the military's knowledge, as they went through all of the motions to prepare for the actual strike, not just the semblance of it. Now, if that's the case, they may well have WANTED this leaked, as the Generals don't really approve of that sort of thing. I can't say what happened for sure here, but what I know is that regardless of whether the President is telling the truth, something majorly wrong and concerning happened here. I think everyone should be concerned about that.	c35akk	2019-06-22 01:46:51

It was only a month ago that he began [personally visiting CIA headquarters](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/top-trump-admin-intel-military-advisers-held-meeting-cia-iran-n1003736) to review Iran intelligence, likely to cherry pick cables in concert with fringe elements in the IC that support war.

This is an extremely unusual behavior for a White House official, but has one notorious, almost identical precedent: [Dick Cheney in the lead up to the Iraq War](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/17/iraq.usa).

Even worse, [Politico reported last week that Bolton is going even further at DoD](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/14/shanahan-defense-trump-pentagon-1365843), bypassing leadership entirely:

>Defense Department officials with direct knowledge of Shanahan’s operations said, he has tolerated a practice by **Bolton and the National Security Council staff of calling Pentagon underlings and inserting themselves deep into the chain of command.** That means the people who work for Shanahan are unprotected from interference by White House staff, who are not in the military’s chain of authority.

Trump does not want war, but he's a genuine moron who acts on instincts which are disproportionately belligerent. Bolton is a smart, patient man who has been pining for war with Iran for decades, and is ensuring that whenever Trump backs himself into a corner, military strikes are designed, planned and ready to execute. This is a scary time."	c35akk	2019-06-21 16:51:04

Edit: To the replies: I'm not concerned with deployment. A stop-loss is when the military completely halts all out-processing and current enlisted remain enlisted until the stop-loss ends. Don't comment ""why did you join then?"" because I served my time, and I've held up my end of the contract I made the the US government. I've also decided that this isn't something I really want to do anymore for multiple reasons that I don't need to justify to anyone besides my family.

Yes, military contracts do have clauses that say you may be pulled back from ""inactive reserves"" however there are stipulations and typically is only a 4 year window after your contract ends *up to a total of 8 years active + inactive time*. Regardless, in order for inactive reserves to be activated it'd take something short of World War 3 for it to happen. 

I do want to say that if your first reaction to my post is ""then you shouldn't have joined!"", then shame on you. I grew up in poverty, my mother worked 3 jobs and we still got evicted endlessly from being unable to pay bills because we needed to eat. I joined the Army because I *had* to, and it has given me opportunities I would have otherwise never been given and I am deeply grateful for it. On the same note, the military lifestyle isn't for everyone and people in the military are very aware of that fact and rather respectful towards it - so before you jump the proverbial gun and hit me with a snarky comment, perhaps you should stop for a moment and reflect on the fact that you're *kind of being a dick*."	c35akk	2019-06-21 14:53:35

------------

Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, the Air Force commander for the Central Command region in the Middle East, said the attack could have endangered “innocent civilians,” even though officials at Central Command continued to assert that the drone was over international waters. He said that the closest that the drone got to the Iranian coast was 21 miles.

Late Thursday, the Defense Department released additional imagery in an email to support its case that the drone never entered Iranian airspace. But the department incorrectly called the flight path of the drone the location of the shooting down and offered little context for an image that appeared to be the drone exploding in midair.

It was the latest attempt by the Pentagon to try to prove that Iran has been the aggressor in a series of international incidents.

[What we know and don’t know about Iran shooting down an American drone.]

Iran’s foreign affairs minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a post on Twitter that he gave what he said were precise coordinates for where the American drone was targeted.

“At 00:14 US drone took off from UAE in stealth mode & violated Iranian airspace,” he said in a tweet that included coordinates that he said were near Kouh-e Mobarak. “We’ve retrieved sections of the US military drone in OUR territorial waters where it was shot down.”

Mr. Trump’s comments on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office reflected the longstanding tension between the president’s desire to be seen as tough on the world stage and his campaign promise to make sure that the United States did not get tangled in more foreign wars.

The president has embraced a reputation as someone who punches back when he is challenged. Only months into his tenure, Mr. Trump launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at an air base in Syria after a chemical weapon attack.

But he has often talked about ending American involvement in long-running conflicts abroad, describing his “America First” agenda as having little room for being the world’s police force. In a tweet in January, he said he hoped that “Endless Wars, especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes” would “eventually come to a glorious end!”

According to Iranian news media, a foreign minister spokesman there said that flying a drone into Iranian airspace was an “aggressive and provocative” move by the United States.

Hossein Salami, the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said crossing the country’s border was “our red line,” the semiofficial Mehr news agency reported.

“We are not going to get engaged in a war with any country, but we are fully prepared for war,” Mr. Salami said at a military ceremony in Sanandaj, Iran, according to a translation from Press TV, a state-run news outlet. “Today’s incident was a clear sign of this precise message, so we are continuing our resistance.”

Iranian news media said the drone had flown over Iranian territory unauthorized, and reported that it had been shot down in the Hormozgan Province, along the country’s southern coast on the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.

Both the United States and Iran identified the aircraft as an RQ-4 Global Hawk, a surveillance drone made by Northrop Grumman.

“This was a show of force — their equivalent of an inside pitch,” said Derek Chollet, a former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs during the Obama administration, speaking of Iran’s decision to shoot down the drone.

James G. Stavridis, who retired as a four-star admiral after serving as the supreme allied commander at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, warned that the two countries were in a dangerous game that could quickly spiral out of control. He described Iran’s downing of the drone, which costs about $130 million, as a “logical albeit highly dangerous escalatory move by Iran.”"	c35akk	2019-06-21 16:34:49

As for what caused him to reverse course on this at the last second - who can say? Maybe Putin called and told him no. Maybe the military finally got through to him that it's a bad idea. Maybe he just got frustrated with all the big words and serious people and decided to sleep on it. In the end it doesn't matter - he is surrounded by war hawks who are foaming at the mouth to bomb Iran, and he is such a weak coward that he will certainly give in to them eventually, or so provoke one of his adversaries that they make the choice for him.	c35akk	2019-06-21 15:33:16

While Congress has the authority to declare war (which hasn't been done since 1942), the President retains the authority to ""wage war"". The 1983 [War Powers Resolution](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/warpower.asp) was an attempt by Congress to curb the President's authority, but had no teeth.

2325	1561119679.0	"The answer is - yes - this article relies on unnamed sources:

> As late as 7 p.m., military and diplomatic officials were expecting a strike, after intense discussions and debate at the White House among the president’s top national security officials and congressional leaders, according to multiple senior administration officials involved in or briefed on the deliberations.
> 
> Officials said the president had initially approved attacks on a handful of Iranian targets, like radar and missile batteries.
> 
> The operation was underway in its early stages when it was called off, a senior administration official said. Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down, the official said.

Serious question: Do you believe this makes the article not credible? If so, is it because you believe the NYT is literally fabricating it, or because the sources were?

Reputable news organizations use unnamed sources frequently - it's kind of a requirement of journalism as often sources will not be prepared to go on the record.  A paper could fabricate stories and assign them to unnamed or anonymous sources of course, but it would be a serious blow to their credibility if they did.  
It's more likely that they could be lied to, but they do have some policies in place to, supposedly, protect against cases where they are lied to by these sources.

~~It's also worth pointing out that NYT explicitly reached out to the White House and the Pentagon for comment on this, giving them a chance to dispute the claims:~~

> ~~Asked about the plans for a strike and the decision to hold back, the White House declined to comment, as did Pentagon officials. No government officials asked The New York Times to withhold the article.~~

*[Second edit: someone below points out that the White House / Pentagon legally can't confirm or deny the claims, so their lack of a response is meaningless in terms of the accuracy of the story]*"	c35akk	2019-06-21 14:21:19

The cost of the US waging war on Iran would be catastrophic and would bring down both sides on top or completely destabilizing the Middle East more than it already is for decades to come. So I’m happy that he backed down but I honestly don’t think he’s going to stay backed down, Trump has wanted a war with Iran for a long while now.	c35akk	2019-06-22 03:06:55

2. According to Iran, they shot down the US drone **after** it entered Iranian airspace, without permission. 

However, let's just assume that the US is telling the truth, and the drone was shot down 9 miles away from Iranian territory. At roughly 400mph, that drone could have reached a major city within 6 minutes. Do you really think that if Iran sent a drone toward a US city, we wouldn't shoot that fucking thing down, before it was 6 minutes away? You're nuts.

But the flaw in his logic is that the situation he was talking about was a situation where the Obama administration said ""We have surrounded X city.""  
  
It was a comment on what is currently happening not what's going to happen. Also ISIS leaders in the city already knew the city was being surrounded and would be attacked.

Same with this situation; the goal is not to kill a bunch of Iranian civilians or members of the military all because the religious  leaders of Iran are trying to stir shit with the US.

If they're going to be proportional in response, you blow something expensive up, doing your best to avoid casualties.  However, any action carries loads of risk that you would not be successful with that goal, which could easily lead to escalation, and it's a little different if you're attacking something on the ground inside a country versus shooting down an unmanned aircraft supposedly in international airspace.

My speculation is because that the hawks in their government can be reasonable sure that the US population and Trump does not want a war that is larger than Iraq or Afghanistan. There is a huge (and valid) resistance to any way.

But why provoke a conflict anyway? My thinking is because the sanctions are hurting them a lot and EU and others are dragging their feet even if they promised to help. If they can destabilize the region with small attacks, nothing that will force any hand, they can hope that other players will start thinking ""Hey, we don't want anything to go down here.

2713	1561121380.0	"I find it interesting the language the United States is using in this conflict.

>To quote the Pentagon: The Pentagon said the drone was 34 kilometers (about 20 miles) away from **Iranian territory** when it was struck.

To anyone not paying attention, that's approximately the distance from the edge of Iranian Airspace to the Iranian mainland. Is the Pentagon alleging the drone was struck inside Iranian Airspace but not over Iranian land?

My best guess is this drone was initially flying a line parallel to the Iranian airspace border between the UAE and Iran near the entrance to the Gulf and it drifted into Iranian Airspace.

Iran published the coordinates where the drone was hit

25°59’43”N 57°02’25”E

That's 15 km closer to Iran and away from where the Pentagon claims the drone was.

Update:  RQ-4 Global Hawk was flying 34km from the **nearest point of land** on the  Iranian coast when it was shot down by an IRGC missile, says Commander  of Air Forces Central Command Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella.

Iranian published complete flight path of the drone prior to this incident report contradicts US allegations."	c35akk	2019-06-21 14:49:40

Attacking a $100M unmanned drone is too perfect of a decision  for it to be just a mistake from a lowly officer or something. If you want to send the U.S. a strong message or decide you want to make an escalation in your relation with the U.S. what's the perfect way to do that? 

You can't have any human casualties because you know the second a U.S. soldier gets even a scratch hellfire will magically start to rain down on your city. So what do you do? Oh look, a state of the art 100 million dollar UN-MANNED drone is flying in international airspace. It's a perfect target to achieve their goal. 

If it really WAS the mistake of some lowly officer that meant to hit the radio volume up button but instead hit the laser-guidance system/fire buttons then Iran would immediately come out and say that's what happened so the U.S. wouldn't get any ideas but they haven't said that."	c35akk	2019-06-21 14:39:19

After the ten turns, I took all their luxuries and made peace.

For the rest of the game, they hated me and would declare war at the first opportunity they could. I would do nothing because there was no way they could hurt me then make peace. At some point, I was annoyed about something else going on in the game or in life so the next time they declared war on me I said ""Fuck it,"" and I turned into Anakin and they were my Tusken Raiders. I didn't have to kill them. In fact, I probably shouldn't have. But I did. I took their capital and the little crap cities they had put up on the northern coast.

He threw the whole bridge into panic, and they were already on edge because captain wanted to bully some speedboats (even the other ships’ crew didn’t like his conduct). So crew panic means no one double checked and then they fired the missile. “Honest mistake” does sound like downplaying the seriousness of what they just did (not to mention they were bullying speedboats because captain wants to be macho man) so it’s still not good to call it that, “stupidity” is more appropriately disparaging.	c35akk	2019-06-22 07:21:40

MAD has kept the peace since WWII. It continues to keep the peace today. By eliminating POTUS' ability to authorize launch you've broken MAD, and thats terrifying.

A strike against Iran, even if not an official declaration of war, would likely cascade into a series of events that would boil over into war. It’s appropriate to ask for Congress’ guidance on the matter, because a strike against Iran is not needed immediately. 

Yes, I’m fully aware the president is the commander and chief, and it’s why time and time again the president has been able to skirt congressional approval for military strikes and even wars, but I’m arguing it shouldn’t be like that. 

The members of Congress can have access to classified information and make a decision. It should require the consensus of Democrats and Republicans. The difference it makes is it creates pause before thousands, tens of thousands, or more lives are injured, killed, and housing, economies, health etc are completely uprooted.

Man that is not the trajectory of popularity of military conflicts doomed to failure. They always start popular, and then in five to ten years after we've spent another $7T and have fuck all to show for it, *then* it will be unpopular. And we'll be stuck.

Opinion polls right now don't mean shit. Every network and talking head will spend 23 hours a day talking about how Trump suddenly matured and became presidential, running stories about supporting our troops, and engaging in the worst kind of military propaganda. Even MSNBC will be running stories about opposing the war without opposing our military, because of course we support our troops! You run the public through that kind of propaganda for 16 months and you see where we end up.

We ran a Vietnam veteran who was injured in battle for his country against a guy who joined the air national guard and lied the country into war. Getting injured for his country and serving in Vietnam became a *liability*. I don't need to tell you how this ends.

She’s not a complete buffoon that would egg on North Korea or pull out of the Iran deal and then continuously instigate shit to start a war over nothing. Instead she’d have most likely put troops on the ground in Syria after her planned no-fly zone didn’t help and she would have totally funded a proxy war in Venezuela and turned that already terrible situation even worse, but the chances of American troops going to Venezuela would be next to nothing.

The millions of Iranians living in the US, Canada, Europe, Dubai, Australia, etc. are happy to be there, and at this point even regime supporters have nothing to believe in.

Is there precedent for actions like this under previous administrations? Absolutely.

Until there is definitive evidence stating the drone was in Iranian airspace, you have no ability to make such conjectures. You must also understand that Trump is not aware of the 24/7 movements of military forces. If the drone was in airspace, and it was successfully shot down there, the war would have commenced immediately. This would be a plan weeks in the making, not overnight.

Another Saddam Hussein can easily spring up in that region in an effort to invade their neighbors and gain limitless resources.

3816	1561146440.0	" If the highest military officials didn't ask reporters to not tell this story, that means they want it out there. Why would they want it out there?

They must believe that the public needs to know about this almost-act-of-war. That's encouraging to know that our military leaders have reached some kind of breaking point where the good of the public is more important that the general trend to minimize public knowledge of military operations. 

This is at least the implication of including this statement in the article. It's sometimes hard to understand subtle maneuvers in a specific industry. For example, what does it look like when a military official acts abnormally? Do you know? I don't. But these reporters do because it's their job. They know that part of the story is not just what is said in the briefings or interviews. It's also how people act relative to their normal behavior. 

If that's still a bit vague, think about Mueller's public briefing a few weeks ago. It's incredibly rare for Mueller to speak publicly. But if you don't know that and just watch the briefing, it looks like a very boring normal briefing where the man who wrote his 400 page report decided to repeat the core conclusions. Nothing that was said in that briefing was new. It was the verbal equivalent of taking out a highlighter and highlighting the important passages. 

But the very fact that he scheduled a public briefing on his own, not being told by anyone, is weird. It's out of character for him. And that itself is further understand of the point of this briefing. The highlighted words are suddenly the appearance of Mueller shooting at the top of his lungs. This act is important. These words are important. 

Same here. The fact that the military officials are not even trying to act like they used to tells us that they're scared of the actions Trump is taking and they want the public to be aware. Presumably to do something about it."	c35akk	2019-06-21 21:47:20

A warning not military action.  Just like them shoting the drone was a show of force to the US who did not know Iran was capable of striking aircraft at that high up.

3827	1561151859.0	I think it might be a little better to kind of understand the motivations behind this.  This is somewhat speculative but the US withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Aka the Iran nuclear deal) at a time when the US intelligence committee concluded [“Iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device”](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf).  Iran for their part is still stuck with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action but now without the support they were promised.  So now the deal just doesn't make any sense.  As such Iranian officials have publicly threatened to resume the nuclear activities that the agreement limits if Iran does not gain the tangible trade and investment benefits it expected from the deal.  To avoid too much attention falling on the fact that they didn't have a particularly good justification for pulling out of the deal and to prevent Iran from setting up their own nuclear program the US is trying to suggest they had good reason for withdrawing from the deal.  Thus far most other countries who wouldn't directly benefit have found the intelligence presented by the US in that regard laughable.   As well the US has been carefully watching the Iranian borders for activity to figure out if and how they intend to continue their nuclear program.  Iran shooting down a drone required a response because the US fully intends to keep watching the situation, and so now they publicly launch fighters and pull them back.  Iran just wants either the deal they were originally promised or to be allowed to pursue their own nuclear program as they were doing before signing the deal.  The US wants to keep Iran from having a nuclear program.	c35akk	2019-06-21 23:17:39

Furthermore, the United States has former CIA director Mike Pompeo leading the State Department and a warmonger in John Bolton as the National Security Adviser dictating foreign policy. Secretary Mike Pompeo has ties to Islamophobic groups, is a climate change denier, is against equal lgbtq+ rights and was eager to scrap the Iran nuclear deal.^[[6]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/12/trumps-would-be-secretary-of-state-has-an-islamophobia-problem/?utm_term=.5a086c37d95d) John Bolton wants war with Iran and has an Islamophobia problem too.^[[7]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/us/pompeo-bolton-muslims.html) 

Upon his appointment National Security Adviser John Bolton began to reverse Trump's former National Security Adviser General McMaster's changes to the National Security Council following some outrageous scandals from Trump's first National Security Adviser General Flynn's tenure. Most people may not remember the *Deep State Memo* conspiracy that eventually led to a number of Flynn layovers being forcibly removed from their positions from the NSC.^[[8]](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/10/heres-the-memo-that-blew-up-the-nsc/)

>The memo at the heart of the latest blowup at the National Security Council paints a dark picture of media, academics, the “deep state,” and other enemies allegedly working to subvert U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a copy of the document obtained by Foreign Policy.

>...The full memo, dated May 2017, is titled “POTUS & Political Warfare.” It provides a sweeping, if at times conspiratorial, view of what it describes as a multi-pronged attack on the Trump White House.

>Trump is being attacked, the memo says, because he represents “an existential threat to cultural Marxist memes that dominate the prevailing cultural narrative.” Those threatened by Trump include “‘deep state’ actors, globalists, bankers, Islamists, and establishment Republicans.”

These people were pushed out for promoting a *leftist conspiracy* against President Trump.^[[9]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/us/politics/rich-higgins-memo-national-security-council.html) 

**John Bolton and his role in the illegal invasion of Iraq**

John Bolton threatened the family of a former diplomat for negotiating with Saddam Hussein to allow weapons inspectors into the country, the diplomat was going against the Bush administration's rhetoric leading up to the Iraq war. The Brazilian diplomat was the former Director General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, he was negotiating with Saddam Hussein to allow weapons inspectors to make unannounced visits to Iraq. John Bolton traveled to the OPCW headquarters in the Hague and threatened the Director General's children if he did not quit.^[[10]](https://theintercept.com/2018/03/29/john-bolton-trump-bush-bustani-kids-opcw/)

Here are 2 examples that harken back to the 1980's illegal Iran-Contra scandal plaguing Republican President Reagan's administration that demonstrate the swampy depth of President Trump's administration;

- President Trump's Attorney General Barr was involved in the aftermath and coverup of the Iran-Contra scandal where the Reagan administration illegally sold arms to Iran and used that money to fund rebels in Nicaragua. During his first tenure as the AG, Barr advised President Bush Sr. to pardon Reagan administrator officials who had broken the law.^[[11]](http://movies2.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1224.html)


- In the 80's John Bolton blocked investigations into the illegal Iran-Contra deal while he worked at the Justice Department.^[[12]](https://www.thenation.com/article/john-bolton-ally-drugrunners/)

>Bolton’s record as Assistant AG for the Office of Legislative Affairs in 1986 and 1987 merits special scrutiny. He “tried to torpedo” Sen. John Kerry’s inquiry into allegations of contra drug smuggling and gunrunning, a committee aide says. When Kerry requested information from the Justice Department, Bolton’s office gave it the long stall, a Kerry aide notes. In fact, says another Congressional aide, Bolton’s staff worked actively with the Republican senators who opposed Kerry’s efforts.

>In 1986 this chum of Meese also refused to give Peter Rodino, then chair of he House Judiciary Committee, documents concerning the Iran/contra scandal and Meese’s involvement in it, Later, when Congressional investigators were probing charges that the Justice Department had delayed an inquiry into gunrunning to the contras, Bolton was again the spoiler. According to Hayden Gregory, chief counsel of a House Judiciary subcommittee on crime, Bolton blocked an arrangement by which his staff had agreed to let House investigators interview officials of the US Attorney’s office in Miami. Bolton refused to speak to us on the subject.

**John Bolton has and always will be a national security risk and yet President Trump appointed him to lead his foreign policy endeavours.^[[13]](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/23/john-bolton-is-a-national-security-threat/)**

We send drones into Iranian territory all the time, this one may have been earlier, but Iran isn't capable of shooting them down. Over IW and on patrol at a low altitude they could shoot one down, or more likely practice and get lucky.

You can think what you want about him being grotesque and vile (he probably is), but at some point it completely blinds you to reality. In that case he just stopped the US war machine, something that neither Bush or Obama would have done.

As a big fan of Boston Legal, I recognize word salad when I see it.  I'm not even joking or trying to put him down: it seems clear he's got a legitimate brain problem.

I actually think we've got a president that's trapped inside his own head in a sense, unable to communicate his thoughts with the world properly, so he looks absolutely batshit even when what's in his head MIGHT not be.  That we ALSO may have a president with a lot of other issues in terms of actual policy and worldview and ego and all the other things people always talk about is almost in a way secondary because we can't even get past the communication issue to determine if that's the case or not."	c35akk	2019-06-21 14:43:09

He genuinely believes the things he says including that millions voted illegally for Clinton or that Obama is the founder of ISIS. He has been recorded saying over 10000 untrue statements but all of these are either things he truly believes on an emotional level or projections of himself into others. He's not capable of creating a false narrative and sticking to it because that would require actual intelligence.	c35akk	2019-06-21 19:17:20

4107	1561140557.0	Trump may be confused about what his base is.  Ever since he hired Bolton, he has been trying to appeal to George W. Bushes base, but that isn't his base.  Trump was hired to reduce immigration and that is pretty much the only thing he was hired to do.  His base has no interest in war with Iran.

4116	1561129248.0	"he's a bully, and a braggart. He ""rules"" by threats, bullying and intimidation, and he hires others to do his dirty work.

The only reason that he ""doesn't like war"" is that in the current climate he knows its going to be hung on him, and he isn't going to be able to dodge the blame. I suspect that he's seeing some significant pushback from higher-ups in the military who are likely to refuse to follow his orders in the current situation, where no-one can honestly justify an attack when they ***know*** that the retaliation and consequences would be horrific.

I also suspect that if Iran did anything that was publicly provable and provocative and that the military supported him on, he'd order an attack immediately. 

If he honestly didn't want war, he wouldn't have deliberately recruited known warmongers and allowed them to run loose. And you can say that he did it out of ignorance and was convinced by someone else, but they are his choice, his appointment, his fault."	c35akk	2019-06-21 17:00:48

That is largely why we went into Iraq and Afghanistan (look at a map), which coincidentally are on the two adjacent sides of Iran.  Actually it is also related to ethnic conflicts that go back thousands of years.

Despite all of the rhetoric, the core paradigm for this world unfortunately is ""might makes right"".  And right now, the US and allies have harnessed that might to create a certain pecking order in the world.  Certain countries such as Iran refuse to submit to that order.  They actually feel it is their moral obligation to do so in order to attempt to balance out the power of the US, which they consider evil.

The US (and allies) view this lack of compliance as a security issue that must be resolved.  Therefore there have been plans for resolving it actively being engaged for many decades.  Many (if not most) of the leaders do not really want to see massive death and destruction, and so they try to engage with non-military action such as financial warfare.

However, unfortunately, unless the entire geopolitical paradigm changes to something that is actually civilized, war with Iran may be inevitable, since they do not seem to be submitting adequately from the financial sanctions etc."	c35akk	2019-06-21 16:51:36

No it doesn't. One more multi-trillion dollar war and your empire is gone. You have the military and the means to destroy it, but you will be destroying your economy while you're at it. Your economy is already getting tired and that's shown on the Feds inability to raise interest rates. You guys are also running massive debt bubbles in various financial sectors. 

If boots on the ground in Iran doesn't destroy you then the further destabilization of the middle east will. It's not as simple as just bombing raids. After Stuxnet, Iran built one of the biggest cyber armies on the planet. I would bet they would make major moves to destabilize American politics.

The tldr is kinda:

Israeli Iran hostilities, Israeli exists, many say it shouldn't and is stolen land Iran happens to think that. Iran has been attempting to develop a nuclear program and is continually sanctioned as most major ally powers in the world dont want nuclear proliferation. Nukes being possible and the hostilities between Iran and Israel are probably the closest we're gonna come to a nuclear war if Iran happens to get nukes. This topic is much more complicated but basically the US, Israel and other spy on Iran to ensure they're not still building nukes, and if they are its kinda assumed Israel would blow up the facilities.

&#x200B;

Oil supply to the world, love it or hate it oil is still HUGELY important in the global economy, less so now then in the past but still very important. The straight of Hormuz is the busiest shipping lanes for oil in the world, historically Iran has used its control over the straight as kinda a nuclear bargaining chip threatening to shut it down to avoid sanctions and... shit this is getting to be a long tldr... basically no one would allow that to happen and the US has stated as much

&#x200B;

4519	1561172179.0	"Congress does not lead the United States, the president does. Congress makes laws and passes budgets. They ratify treaties and declare war because these are essentially laws. It’s not about a singular decision, it’s about legislation surrounding a decision. 

In 2019, declaring war is almost irrelevant compared to the last 200+ years. It used to be that you’d have to call up the army, increase the draft, ration essential materials and so on. All things that congress should weigh in on as they impact all kinds of aspects of Americans lives all across the country. 

Now, we have a volunteer military, a strong supply chain and vast national reserves. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have impacted ordinary Americans in almost no significant way. Nobody is rationing sugar or sheet metal and other than the tragic loss of life from the 4kish soldiers, most people wouldn’t even know the war was happening. 

Times are different now and the strength of the United States comes from our singular leader who is democratically elected and transfers power peacefully. 

You can’t neuter the presidents ability to conduct international affairs just because you don’t like him. It’s his responsibility, not that of congress to maintain relationships and flex the muscle of the US. He is beholden to all Americans, not just a small group in congressional district or single state."	c35akk	2019-06-22 04:56:19

I do agree with your statement about lukewarm relations and not being the aggressor. It’s also somewhat of a risk there too, which I’m sure folks on here will chime in and say “Trump is too dangerous no matter what!” and it definitely looks that way. 

What I’m trying to figure out in my head is: if Trump had the opportunity to maintain that same lukewarm relationship, would there still be risk for Nuclear armament that he’s clearly trying to do - it’s the manner in which he’s doing it that is the risk here. 

To that point, he backed down and no one really knows why. Could be political propaganda for his re-election (everyone who hates Trump will fall into this bucket) or is there something else we are all unaware of?

4528	1561174474.0	"I don’t disagree, but lately every bit of communication on both sides really doesn’t allow or give insight into the solution, because everyone is focused on the problem. 

What I’m really trying to say is, everyone is so quick and speedy to point fingers (I’m just as guilty) but when challenged with an opportunity to discuss solving the problem, neither side is taking accountability for having solutions.

Further, what I’m hearing from folks lately is, “Trump sucks, he needs to go!” But when asking the question “OK, what should he be doing about it?” the replies are all “He’s the President and should know how to do the job well”.

Regardless of who is President, it’s so easy to point fingers but when asked how to solve the problem no one has any unbiased opinions or strategy, it’s just more of the same old name calling.

For me this is the core contradiction not just with Trump, but with his base. They're constantly alternating between cheering on war, and denouncing war mongers. On the one hand it looks like they sympathize with liberal war protesters, but on the other they all probably know too well the cost of war and don't want to start one over stupid shit.

She was SoS when we fell for Ali Abdullah Saleh's nonsense claims that Iran was supporting Huthis in Yemen and subsequently supported Saudi's war there.  
She likely would have shown more follow-through to bring down Maduro.  
And, she's just as much of a likudnik as all the conservative hawks so Iran could have become a target for her too.

4711	1561169063.0	"I'm not in favor of attacking Iran over this, but we do have other reasons to attack them. I do think we have to watch their nuclear capability closely if we don't want cities like Chicago and New York and Los Angeles and Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to get glassed by either Iran directly or by terrorist groups they support. They've publicly announced many times that that is exactly what they want to do. 

As long as we can properly monitor their nuclear work without going to war that's fine. If we need to take out their anti-aircraft capability to better fly monitoring drones there I would be in favor of that too. A lot of people will claim they have a right to their airspace, but they seem like the most likely instigators we currently have of nuclear war and/or nuclear terrorism. So I think surveillance is justified. 

I guess it's a bit like the no fly zone thing with Iraq. Same logic. The US and Israel need to be able to keep an eye on what they are doing. We are the ones whose cities may get glassed if Iran gets nukes. It's easy for other countries to just give Iran the benefit of the doubt. They won't be targeted until after the threat has been revealed by the mushroom clouds above our cities. Israel and the US would be the first targets."	c35akk	2019-06-22 04:04:23

Thank you for linking to the article about the 37% of voters.  I would like to see the exact question posed to the audience and whether the poll clarified what is included in ""the media"".  Is it just large news organisations or also opinion commentators, or what about something like [PatriotPundit.com](https://PatriotPundit.com)? *NOTE: I made up that website as a silly example, but it actually exists*

Also interesting to see the clear split between Republicans polled and Democrats.  I wonder what the results would be if they followed up asking if the media lies about Obama?

And I suppose there is benefit to questioning what we are told.

Though, I do think Trump's comments about the media is a detriment to our society.  And, frankly, I am surprised and saddened by how effective it has been.  I really don't understand why people believe him -- despite being caught over and over in a lie, but don't believe news organizations when they literally have videos of him caught in a lie.  

BUT, this is what we voted for and this is who we are.  AND this is how his supporters want to be treated.  Though I am constantly surprised when his supporters don't seem to actually want to be treated according to their own words -- be it the rural areas getting $2 for every $1 they pay in, or the farmers getting welfare, or the elderly on their government run healthcare, etc."	c35akk	2019-06-21 14:19:05
4838	1561124300.0	"Is that accurate? If so, I guess the lack of response from the White House is meaningless in terms of establishing credibility. I'll make a note on the original comment to that effect.

The point still stands though - unnamed or anonymous sources are waved around as a way to dismiss reporting, but they aren't by themselves a red flag in terms of credibility (if we're talking about a reputable news outlet like NYT).  
We should maintain healthy skepticism - it's possible they're being misled by their unnamed sources, but when they publish a piece like this, we're not talking about anonymous cranks making wild claims. The paper is asserting that they know the identity of the people making the claims, that they're ""multiple senior administration officials"", and that they consider them at least credible."	c35akk	2019-06-21 15:38:20

Look back on your life’s relationships. We’ve all had nasty verbal fights with the various people in our lives, but they when people start butting heads they don’t immediately resort to harping on the most hurtful thing they can. Initial conflict occurs, and when both sides are dug in, the insults and tempers tend to ramp up.

4963	1561137122.0	Aaron Sorkin is an amazing writer, but why exactly? Are you saying it's a compelling argument or that trump is thinking like that? I guess one could argue that Trump is being unpredictable by not attacking, but that isn't really the case because obviously Iran was assuming he *wouldn't* attack. One downside to not being a warmonger is that people are going to quite reasonably assume it would take a pretty significant act of war to provoke you into something. Maybe Iran wouldn't for instance have shot down a manned fighter jet because that would have been too strong a provocation to war.	c35akk	2019-06-21 19:12:02

>I was confused as to why we were supporting a Republican cunt like that.

The part that gets me is the flip side of this. That for all the bitching and whinging on that Republicans do about how evil socialism is, and how awful life is under Islamic religious rule, they're vocally and strongly supporting a group that is **both** of those things.

I mean, these are the guys saying even the slightest bit of “socialist” policy being implemented will irrevocably put us on the fast track to becoming the next Soviet Union, and that anything Islamic is inherently incompatible with anything resembling human rights, right?

So their solution to the Ayatollah and the Islamic Republic is Muslim Mao? Sharia Stalin? Yeah, sure guys, you love the people of Iran so much that's what you want for them?

Of course it's all posturing, they don't actually believe all that shit about socialism and how dire its implementation is, but it sure makes their support of MeK look completely bass-ackwards and worse than their accusations of Obama directly supporting terrorists in Iraq.

>I'd love to see the IR get toppled INTERNALLY, not from parasitic foreign powers.

I think we all would. I think the preferred outcome would be a Soviet-style government implosion. You can't really give the USSR credit for much that's positive, but the way in which they wound down their entire political system was pleasantly bloodless."	c35akk	2019-06-22 07:25:04

5256	1561125688.0	"This post a just a tad bit confusing because it sounds like John and Donald want the same thing but I don't really see it as that. I see it as John wanting to try and convince Donald into going to war, not that Donald wants to go to war like John does. I do not believe Donald shares the same insights as John ever since he called out the war on Iraq. He definitely knows this war wouldn't be any different.  
  
That being said, the people around Donald will try to pressure him into going to war but I don't believe he will do it. The only exception is if the CIA and or other entities provoke Iran into doing something stupid enough that convincing Trump then on after wouldn't be so difficult as it wouldn't be for any person in that position given the circumstances that may possibly be staged similar to how the war in 1964 started"	c35akk	2019-06-21 16:01:28

Tell them that Americans lead the forefront of renewable energy and that pushing for it will keep the US as world leaders of innovation, while also freeing us from giving tons of oil money to brown people. Standing ovation.

Tell them how back when America was ""great"", every kid could easily afford to go to college.

Now, whether you choose to believe him or not is a personal decision. But asking this question leads me to believe you don't care to see what was said (because it takes about four seconds to find), and just want someone to confirm your assumption."	c35akk	2019-06-21 15:42:01

I get the impression that he enjoys being the antagonist, the underdog, the bully, the centre of attention etc etc, but I don't think he really has the stomach or the work ethic to motivate him to actually hold real power or endure real scrutiny.

The guy is a bona fide asshole with no perspective, and he is dangerous as president, but that danger stems more from ignorance and stupidity and weakness and desire for attention rather than hunger for more and more power. He wants to eat burgers and bang models and lie around watching TV while people obsess over him, he doesn't like having to actually do stuff.

My comment was reflective of the entire situation with Iran and his international policies in general.

Just so you know, the national debt is a nonissue as long as your GDP continues to grow enough to service the debt payments. China has twice as much national debt as a function of their GDP and it doesn't stop them spending on the  military. 

Inflation has been well within targets for a while so unless it starts spiraling out of control you can't claim the national debt means anything.

I'm not sure where you're from but it sounds like you've never visited the US. We are currently enjoying an extremely prosperous time over here. A comment like ""finish you guys off"" really makes absolutely no sense when companies are making profit hand over fist, unemployment is at an all time low, the stock market is at an all time high, and GDP growth is averaging over 3% a year while the fed interest rates are going up and inflation is hovering between 1.3% and 1.5% a year.

Iranian ships rescued the crew of the Front Altair tanker as well. They admit to shooting down the drone which they considered to be violating Iranian airspace, and the U.S. is aware that the gov. of Iran considers it such and typically avoids flying through it. This whole thing stinks of Bolton's blue balls for war with another oil country. I'm not denying that there are some tensions but literally all the U.S. has to do is stop threatening to sanction Iran, then Iran will not threaten to close the straight.

Trump pulled out of the deal that gave them security for literally no reason but a dick measuring with an old president. 

Putting Iran in the position that they must protect their sovereignty like any rational actor and building a nuke to ensure their security and deter invasion is literally the only recourse to TRUMPs actions. 

All the while we give nuclear tech to the guy who chops people up with bonesaws.

Everything Iran does has legitimate purpose. They are exactly what we would do in these situations. 

I have zero interest in flexing on them for the Saudis and Bibi. They can do it themselves if they want. And every soldier that dies is on Trump. It's unfortunate they will die. I wish they didn't have to.

Make no mistake, any action taken by the US on Iran has nothing to do with an American interest in human rights, it is only done with the intent of furthering American imperialism, both in the MidEast and the rest of the world. Your support for the war is therefore a support of imperialism. 

Also, I would trust that your dislike of Iran for their human rights abuses, sponsoring terrorism etc would also apply to Saudi Arabia, who is far worse than Iran yet enjoys American and European backing?

So - bad tax policy
Bad trade policy
Now shall we talk about his foreign affairs policy? Is it possible to even understand it? Threatens N Korea with nuclear annihilation for testing weapons one year. the next year they test weapons and he calls Kim his best friend. 
GIven his recent reaction to Tehran they may well be his best friend within a couple of months - or glass - who can say - because he has no clear policy initiative.

""Sadly, his concerns were well founded. Even before he abandoned the agreement, Israeli intelligence proved that Iran was lying when it insisted that it only wants nuclear technology for energy production. The Iranians have openly admitted its plans for breaking the deal in days. Instead of renegotiating the agreement, as President Trump repeatedly offered to do, or merely abiding by the terms of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty that it signed in 1968, Iran is in the process of exceeding the limits on its stockpile of enriched uranium outlined in the deal that it signed in 2015."""	c35akk	2019-06-21 23:04:02

This article was from 2011, so about halfway through his 2 terms and he had already basically glassed Pakistan with endless drone strikes. His administration resulted in an even more war torn Middle East, and the deaths of countless innocent lives.

This one has infographics on the number of strikes ordered, the number of enemy deaths, civilian deaths, and child deaths. Obama was many things and earned plenty of accolades but he should never have been given the Nobel peace prize because his foreign policy in the Middle East was antithetical to the very idea of peace. 

I think that what the guy you were replying to meant was that it is strange for a person to be recognized for their efforts to bring about peace while they, at the same time, are bombing other countries, carelessly killing hundreds, if not thousands, while another guy who has plausible reasons to execute military strikes on a certain country, decides not to in fear of unnecessary death and suffering."	c35akk	2019-06-22 03:00:41

How on Earth is this whataboutism? It's a case of calling out hypocrisy, whataboutism is a form of deflection where you dismiss one person's misdoings by pointing out someone else doing something similar.

If someone said ""Trump had a private phone line and is getting spied on by Russia and China to it!"" and someone chimes in with ""Yeah, but Hillary Clinton had a private email server!"" 

That's whataboutism.

Saying ""Trump had a private phone line and was spied on by Russia and China, but nobody on the right seems to care about that while they were perpetually outraged about Hillary's private email server!"" is making a point that people are inconsistent about the issue."	c35akk	2019-06-21 18:41:11

6149	1561200960.0	"Anyone who wants to change the situation.

First understanding the motivations for these kinds of actions means understanding what actions are likely to lead to escalation and which ones aren't.  For someone who doesn't understand these countries motivations every action will feel like a dice roll where you're unable to understand the outcomes. In this case though when you consider the foreign policy shooting down a drone just isn't likely to actually lead to real escalation.  The consequences for that are much more likely to be political.  Whereas Iran making progress on their own nuclear energy program without US support may lead to actual military escalation.  

Second, the best way to push against the use of military action in Iran is to push against the motivations behind it.  Generally in this case by either holding a position which supports the US resuming their obligations under the joint comprehensive plan of action or by holding a position which supports US withdrawal from the region and allowing Iran to develop a nuclear program with the support of other nations.  I'm not saying war is good or anything, but you can't effectively act against something you don't understand.  So long as the US maintains its current stance on Iran's nuclear energy program a military presence in the region will be seen as a necessity as the US has few tools capable of enforcing that policy.  You must remove the underlying motivation by changing foreign policy before that changes.

Third understanding what voices are pushing for war is also very important.  In this case we also know that much of the decision to pull out of the JCPOA comes back to influence from George Nader, a lobbyist for the United Arab Emirates and Elliott Broidy who is currently under investigation for his financial dealings in Ukraine with businesses who had strong financial ties to Yuri Soloviev.  Minimizing the amount of say these kinds of people have in foreign policy making has got to be among the first steps toward any kind of deescalation.  Otherwise any voice pushing for peace will be matched by others in more powerful positions pushing for war.

You can be against all war and military action but so long as the US maintains the military presence it does though the military will be one of the tools it uses to enforce its foreign policy decisions.  So when it comes to the realpolitik a peaceful political stance is one which pushes for foreign policy which reduces the need for military action, one which pushes for internal policy that reduces the political power of war hungry individuals, and one which pushes for budgetary policy which systematically reduces military spending and buildup.  If you don't understand the policy and decision making you cannot turn your desires into an enforceable position, and so you're just a voice on the wind.  So you should care why these things are happening because it's only by understanding them that you know where to put pressure or even what position you need to be advocating for."	c35akk	2019-06-22 12:56:00

What is bothersome is he just took the chains off Iran’s nuclear program.  The article says Iran announced they are going to make more nuclear weapons!  Of course Iran was provoked, we sent spy drones offshore into their territory.  Now the US government is the one giving obscure data about the exact location of the drone?  This is why nobody trusts the government.  
So what we have is a hostile country, who responds to provocation, who has plans of making bombs the size of entire cities, and a Republican Party with an agenda.  I usually dislike everything about him, but I’m glad Trump did not order the strikes.  I hope this gives Congress time to debate military action, as it’s supposed to.

Trump says it was international waters. And released a video of some blurry bullshit without any GPS coordinates. I refuse the ludicrous idea that this administration is credible. Demand evidence for everything.

It looks like Trump deliberately flew a drone they were willing to risk losing into their waters to bait/test them and false flag more tension.

In this case, you have Iran funding terrorist organizations like Hamas and Houthi Rebels (that have done a lot of harm to regional stability (though the US and Saudi Arabia don't have clean hands either)). Those groups proxy attack Israel and Saudi Arabia. Plus Iran's clear efforts to build a nuclear weapons which could further fuel a nuclear arms race in the region (though the US had temporarily solved that problem with the JCPOA that Trump unilaterally pulled out of). Plus several attacks on oil tankers that threaten the oil exports of the region. And now Iran directly shooting down a US drone over international waters.

All of that tension builds. For example, around the same day the same day as the tanker attack, an Iranian provided cruise missile launched by Houthi rebels hit a Saudi airport killing 26 civilians. Shit is fucked in the middle east and without a president that wants to de-escalate the situation tensions will keep on building until something snaps."	c35akk	2019-06-21 23:59:49

An off the top of my head (but not perfectly applicable) example would be his recent statements about international interference in our elections.  He has spent so much time defending that he did not accept any influence of the sort during his 2016 campaign.  There is a lot of evidence that he did.  Let's say he actually didn't though, and perhaps his staff did or a series of coincidences led to the appearance that illegal influence happened.  It's a massive slap in the face to hear him say ""I probably would, if given the opportunity"".

I guess my point in replying to you is simply to point out that he has a demonstrable history of lying that compels a lot of people (myself included) to be utterly unwilling to give him the benefit of the doubt.  If your goal here is to convince someone to do so, then you will need to put considerable effort into it.

Nobody else has the forward air bases, the aircraft, the tankers, or the drone technology.

To take that and try to spin it to say the US would be fine and dandy with an Iranian or North Korean reconnaissance drone flying just outside US territorial waters is crazy. We wouldn't even let one fly over a carrier battle group in the open ocean, we'd intercept it and try to turn it back via radio, then try to force it off-course, then we'd down it.

""By international law, the notion of a country's sovereign airspace corresponds with the maritime definition of [territorial waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters)  as being 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) out from a nation's coastline.  Airspace not within any country's territorial limit is considered  international, analogous to the ""[high seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters)""  in maritime law. However, a country may, by international agreement,  assume responsibility for controlling parts of international airspace,  such as those over the oceans. For instance, the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) provides air traffic control services over a large part of the Pacific Ocean, even though the airspace is international."""	c35akk	2019-06-21 15:01:37

6437	1561128102.0	"The Lie

BY SIR WALTER RALEGH


Go, soul, the body’s guest, 

Upon a thankless errand; 

Fear not to touch the best; 

The truth shall be thy warrant. 

Go, since I needs must die, 

And give the world the lie. 



Say to the court, it glows 

And shines like rotten wood; 

Say to the church, it shows 

What’s good, and doth no good. 

If church and court reply, 

Then give them both the lie. 



Tell potentates, they live 

Acting by others’ action; 

Not loved unless they give, 

Not strong but by a faction. 

If potentates reply, 

Give potentates the lie. 


Tell men of high condition, 

That manage the estate, 

Their purpose is ambition, 

Their practice only hate. 

And if they once reply, 

Then give them all the lie. 



Tell them that brave it most, 

They beg for more by spending, 

Who, in their greatest cost, 

Seek nothing but commending. 

And if they make reply, 

Then give them all the lie. 


Tell zeal it wants devotion; 

Tell love it is but lust; 

Tell time it is but motion; 

Tell flesh it is but dust. 

And wish them not reply, 

For thou must give the lie. 



Tell age it daily wasteth; 

Tell honor how it alters; 

Tell beauty how she blasteth; 

Tell favor how it falters. 

And as they shall reply, 

Give every one the lie. 


Tell wit how much it wrangles 

In tickle points of niceness; 

Tell wisdom she entangles 

Herself in overwiseness. 

And when they do reply, 

Straight give them both the lie. 



Tell physic of her boldness; 

Tell skill it is pretension; 

Tell charity of coldness; 

Tell law it is contention. 

And as they do reply, 

So give them still the lie. 



Tell fortune of her blindness; 

Tell nature of decay; 

Tell friendship of unkindness; 

Tell justice of delay. 

And if they will reply, 

Then give them all the lie. 



Tell arts they have no soundness, 

But vary by esteeming; 

Tell schools they want profoundness, 

And stand too much on seeming. 

If arts and schools reply, 

Give arts and schools the lie. 



Tell faith it’s fled the city; 

Tell how the country erreth; 

Tell manhood shakes off pity; 

Tell virtue least preferreth. 

And if they do reply, 

Spare not to give the lie. 



So when thou hast, as I 

Commanded thee, done blabbing— 

Although to give the lie 

Deserves no less than stabbing— 

Stab at thee he that will, 

No stab the soul can kill.



Edit for Context on The Lie: The Lie is a political and social criticism poem probably written by Sir Walter Raleigh circa 1592. Speaking in the imperative mood throughout, he commands his soul to go ""upon a thankless errand"" and tell various people and organizations of their misdeeds and wrongdoings. And if they object, Raleigh commands, publicly accuse them to be lying, or ""give them the lie."" To ""give the lie"" was a common phrase in Raleigh's time of writing. -Wikipedia

When they started fracking oil was selling for $120 a barrel. As soon as the US became and exporter of oil, OPEC removed its production cap and prices plummeted to ~$30 a barrel. This was a deliberate attempt to make US shale and fracking companies unprofitable. Once it became apparent that the low prices were not forcing anyone out of business OPEC started capping exports again, and Venezuela's production disappeared because their economy and government could not sustain itself in the cheap oil environment.  Prices rebounded to around ~$50 to $60, and US producers started making money again.

On top of that the Iranian government nationalized British and American Oil assets in the 1950s. This led to a CIA organized coup against the leader of Iran, and the installation of a Shah with more favorable policies. Iranian people could not stand it anymore and in 1979 they overthrew the Shah and became more of a theocratic society, which scared the shit out of the US.

6650	1561125921.0	"There seems to be a misunderstanding on reddit about what constitutes international airspace. Iran claims their Flight Information Region (FIR) as their airspace. They said this in their statement today. This is not consistent with international law. The maps that you are seeing are likely FIR maps. Here is a decent map showing FIR and international airspace laid on top of one another:

https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00ecdbb1fb283aabf1d62b3c550bb47b.webp

Iran unequivically shot this drone down in international airspace. However, the US was aware that it was risky to fly in Iran's FIR as evidenced by this Reuters article from last fall warning commercial planes against flying in Iran's (FIR) airspace:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-us-aviation/united-states-issues-fresh-warning-to-airlines-about-using-iranian-airspace-idUSKCN1LR06X

It is also interesting to note that the article also mentions that Iran intercepted a plane crossing into their FIR, which would have again been the proper protocol in this scenario.

Either way, the US was likely trying to provoke a response, and Iran gave it to them. Not a great move. Ultimately, the difference is that Iran claims that their FIR is not international airspace, which is not wholly true. The area it was shot down was within the FIR, but it was also international airspace.

You don’t need to be stealth 100% of the time when gathering intelligence. Every country gathers intelligence about others, it’s absolutely not a secret that everyone does it. 

Also, the fact that Iran can shoot this drone down at 60,000 feet shows that they are pretty capable and technologically advanced. The RQ-4 (this drone) is not a secret and has a huge wingspan.

I'm reminded of the Dune series, where the protagonist threatened to destroy the source of spice, the life-blood of that universe.  I can't remember the exact quote, but he said something to extent that the power to destroy a thing, gives you power over it.  

Economically, the world cannot deal with a massive spike in oil prices.  Militarily, we can't stop Iran from closing the Gulf if we go to war.  It's too tight of an area, and Iran's military is designed to make the most of their coastline that runs along the Gulf, relying on missiles that can quickly be moved to avoid counter-attacks, fishing boats and such that act as intel/targeting stations, and high speed, highly maneuverable attack boats.  Politically, the world will look at us as bearing primary responsibility for bringing economic pain to the world twice in less than 11 years.  

The EU is already playing with the idea of having an alternative to the dollar as the world's reserve currency (this gives us much of our economic clout) and a war with Iran would hasten this.

Now the intelligence community days Iran attacked those tankers, other countries are also giving that more and more support to that claim as time went on. The intelligence community is now saying the drone was operating in international air space. 

Isn't it funny how all of the sudden Reddit's opinion is that this is all lies but was staunch supporters of the intelligence community just a little while ago?

Honestly my mind is that it wreaks of pushing views on Reddit which unfortunately leads to people thinking upvotes means something is correct and justified based off of others opinions (this is why Russian bots love Reddit, they can push opinions here easily and no one wants to be the odd man out on here so they quickly change their support)

The obviously left leaning main stream media isn't even trying to bolster Iran's claims. Nancy and her crew aren't screaming to not take a reactionary measure.

The only exception is 'annexing territory', but considering how much force projection and warmongering is being done, it's pretty much the same. This is not a defense of Russia, because those guys are shit, but more an indictment of the USA. It's all about oil and military contracts, anyway.

They haven’t hurt that much though. He is a rabid deregulator and tax reform certainly helped as well. Manufacturing has actually seen employment gains for the first time in decades and freight activity has hit all time highs. America is also the number one oil producer in the world for the first time since the 60s.

Coincidentally to Trump the boomers retiring means blue collar fields are becoming competitive again. It’s not uncommon for a steelworker, truck driver, electricians, etc. to make $60-$100k as well as benefits becoming the norm. This has people feeling good about this economy as well.

Also somewhat coincidentally to Trump global markets have severely lagged behind the US. American equities is seen more and more as the place to put your money as nowhere else looks safe.

There have been numerous idled mills that have come back online since then and steel has a huge trickle into the rest of manufacturing. 

A huge intangible effect of Trump’s whole mantra is that it spurs investor and business confidence. There is a spirit in the economy and markets and when that spirit is optimistic the economy booms.

>Obama sends pallets of cash to Iran *crickets*

Yes, Iran was owed money. It wasn't a gift. It was part of an internationally applauded agreement to get them to tone down their nuclear program, which they were complying with. Part of the deal was to release THEIR funds. Do you think Erica should make deals and then not pay their bills?


>Sells arms to Saudi Arabia *crickets*

I don't like it, but did Obama bypass Congress like Trump?


>Obama detains children in camps at the border *crickets*

Not a fan, but Obama wasn't using foreigners as a scapegoat for all of our problem in a way that resembles German propaganda before WWII.



>Now what must be acknowledged is that the democrats don’t care because scandal free first African American President Obama is in charge.. so no one gives a fuck.. aside from the people at chapotraphouse (and I hate those fuckers) who call out Obama for this bullshit what I think REALLY annoys Trump supporters is the fact that democrats act like what Trump is doing is UNPRECEDENTED.


Not all of it is, but much of it is. He has no regard for the law or for checks and balances and his policies are damaging. He makes decisions on the fly and ignores his advisors and causes long term damage to the country for the sake of short term election gains.



>Lefty: well even thought Trump is doing exactly what Obama is going ORANGE MAN BAD THEREFORE FASCISM 


Orange Man Bad is a feeble attempt at dismissing legitimate criticism. He is a bad president and a bad person. Most of what he has done is objectively not good. That's why people don't like him.

>Like you do realise trump supporters wouldn’t give a fuck about your criticism of trump if it was criticising Obama for the exact same thing for the last 8 years.


Trump supporters are not logical, as logical and informed people wouldn't support an objectively terrible president. It's a cult of personality and tribalism. Further, Obama tried to reach across the aisle as the duty of the president is to represent the interests of all voters, not just his voters.



>Democrats don’t care about human injustice AS LONG AS THERE’s A D NEXT TO THEIR NAME

The country isn't simply two homogenous groups of people, but tribalism is much stronger on the right.  Democrats stopped supporting Anthony Weiner after his scandal. Republicans held strong support for Roy Moore. Just one example."	c35akk	2019-06-22 00:08:46

With building nuclear weapons? Haha no. Iran did not say they would continue their nuclear weapons program while the US was involved in the deal. That would've been a clear violation, and it would've resulted in heavy sanctions from every nation involved with the deal. By the way, of all the countries involved in the deal, we are the only one to pull out.

>and I hope you dont honestly believe the leader of Iran stopped that development do you?

It's not about what I believe. It's about what IAEA inspectors found or didn't find. Iran passed inspections while we were involved in the deal. Once we broke our word and pulled out, they kicked out the inspectors and started up their nuclear weapons program again.

Iran was under heavy scrutiny from 6 countries and international inspection agencies. Nobody had any doubts that Iran was abiding by the agreement. Trump didn't pull us out because they violated any part of the agreement. It was a unilateral move without any provocation from Iran.

It's not hard to change the location of a strike. It's literally a radio call en route. 

That's basically all close air support is, a jet flying out to a location and dropping bombs... meh, somewhere? you'll find out when you get there.

Bombing missions aren't like they were in WW2 where they fly out to a target drop and fly back. It's a far more dynamic and ever changing process.

Also, an airstrike on a building where a drone is stored will almost certainly destroy it. We've been perfecting ""bunker busters"" to utterly destroy cave fortifications deep underground for nearly 20 years.

Chances are good that drone is in a hangar. Even a solidly reinforced hangar won't withstand a direct hit. Anyone and anything inside would also be completely annihilated.

Generation names only widely catch on *once a generation becomes relevant and has defining factors*, not when they're being born.

Repealing Citizens United means a constitutional amendment. That means we need an overwhelming majority in both houses of Congress (2/3). But this is the first focus we need. Term limits can come later. I guess in effect I am saying that instead of worrying about anything else, our first question to candidates is, ""How do you feel about the Citizen United Decision and would you be amenable to a constitutional amendment redefining the the word ""person"" as it is contained therein.""

A couple of months prior to this incident the US destroyed half of the Iranian fleet, and blew up a couple of oil platforms. The strait of Hormuz was mined and several USN ships got struck by mines and even Iraqi aviation. Meaning the context of Iran Air was that it was shot down during open hostilities. 

Read up on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Stark_incident. There was a real possibility of single aircraft coming in for attack runs and successfully engage and cripple at least a frigate. This happened less than a year prior. Granted, this was a Iraqi attack, but that was the level of risk in this 'no war' as you put it.

Do you think the USS Vincennes went in for killing 300 civilians that day? Did they wake up and say 'hey let us kill some innocent people'? Or did they make a horrible mistake? Shit happens during war. Same with MH-17. Don't think they went in for killing innocent people. Should they face trial? Yes. Could they reasonably be acquitted? Absolutely. We've got the 20/20 hindsight. Those people did not when they fired, and tragedy was the result. Do not think it was malice, when incompetence could just as easily explain it.

> One very interesting aspect which Wyatt-Brown talks about in ""Southern Honor"" is the slave patrols, which would generally be made up of lowerclass whites, and led by slightly better off Yeoman farmers, and often found themselves in conflict with slaveowners, especially those who were seen as too lenient and lacking in discipline. The men of the slave patrol had a vested interest in ensuring the blacks remained the lowest rung of society, and they felt threatened by masters who, to quote one incident ""upheld his negroes in their rascality"" - in this case didn't whip one of his slaves enough for a perceived transgression.

Is that social conditioning, or just wanting to stay one step above the negroes? Or this one:

> They don't only speak to the possibility of black persons negatively affecting the labor market at the expense of poor whites, or of the 'negroes' elevating themselves above whitemen, ""the slaveholder and nonslaveholder sharing the same fate; all be degraded to a position of equality with free negroes

7309	1561162905.0	"> Once it became apparent that the low prices were not forcing anyone out of business OPEC started capping exports again, and Venezuela's production disappeared because their economy and government could not sustain itself in the cheap oil environment. Prices rebounded to around ~$50 to $60, and US producers started making money again.

So US oil producers will upset a fragile situation that they’re already benefiting from... why, exactly? This is tinfoil hat silliness. If the US wouldn’t invade to “stamp out the competition” when prices were low, why the hell would they do it when prices are high?

Not everything’s about oil.

> On top of that the Iranian government nationalized British and American Oil assets in the 1950s. This led to a CIA organized coup against the leader of Iran, and the installation of a Shah with more favorable policies. Iranian people could not stand it anymore and in 1979 they overthrew the Shah and became more of a theocratic society, which scared the shit out of the US.

Your framing of history is very messy.

- Only the British had oil assets in Iran. The Americans were more worried about Mossadegh’s (do you not even know his name?) alleged weakness towards communism than oil. The British pressure on Iran (against US advice) has provoked a crisis in Iran and American intelligence officials were paranoid that a communist coup was imminent. This was the Cold War, after all. The US honestly did not care who got Iran’s oil as long as it wasn’t the communists.
- The Shah was not “installed”, he was already Shah of Iran. The coup just gave him more power.
- The revolution of 1979 had pretty much nothing to do with Iran’s oil policies. It was more concerned with the authoritarian nature of the Shah’s regime. The Islamic revolutionaries highjacked the movement, and wound up installing a new theocratic government that was far, far more authoritarian and cruel than the Shah’s ever was.

> I encourage you to do your own research, but the US has a pattern of invading countries that nationalize our oil investments. I don't think it is a coincidence.

Not really, actually. The US never had significant investments in Iraq or Iran to be nationalized. The US accepted compensation when Mexico nationalized its oil in the 1930s. Same with Venezuela in the 70s."	c35akk	2019-06-22 02:21:45

&#x200B;

I'm pretty certain we would always keep satellites above the middle eastern region considering we have troops there. So then it comes down to cost, does it cost more to shift a satellite camera maybe a few degrees or risk a $200M drone for pictures. 

&#x200B;

> also, the fact that Iran can shoot this drone down at 60,000 feet shows that they are pretty capable and technologically advanced 

The Soviets shot down a U2 @ 70500ft in the 60s. Granted the U2 is bigger, but not by much with only a 10ft wider wingspan and the U2 flies faster. I think it shows that the Iranians are always looking up vs tech capabilities.

1. Bush era: An attack on the world trade centers that killed 3000 people, coupled with a warmonger President who lied to the American people. 

1. Obama era: The uprising of ISIL and Yemeni civil war, along with the Aden unrest.

Has Trump had to deal with any 1080p beheading videos released by ISIL? Has Trump had to deal with anything that resulted in mass civilian casualties from a foreign attacker on US soil?

Given that the US Navy has been the major proponent behind protecting trade routes around the world since the end of WWII and the dynamic of what’s going on in that waterway the past couple of months I think you it’s easy to infer that the drone that was shot down was just monitoring vessels passing through the strait. 

Was it spying on Iran? Definitely plausible, but if it was in international waters as you claimed, the Iranians have no grounds to deliberately shoot it down.

Contrary to what you said, Muller established very clear evidence that Trump obstructed justice on several occasions. The fact that he is still standing is a very solid indication but it isn't the only one: the GOP openly cheating elections, appointing corrupted servants in all positions of power or the popular vote being ignored are other very good indicators.

So, why are ""we"" not attacking them?

Israel, also a destabilizing force to be reckoned with. Over 25 UN mandates that they do not comply with, on relation to land around their own country that they have occupied. If the US is feeling like the international police man, they may wanna focus elsewhere, don't you agree?

What did Iran do? Oh and before you think I'm an Iranian or otherwise Muslim crazy person: what did Afghanistan do? Yemen? Or.... Vietnam? Oh forget that bit.

Back to where I started. There is *currently* no single action by Iran that warrants any aggression by the US.

Removing First Amendment rights from corporations [might do more harm than good](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2014/7/2/5860732/six-reasons-liberal-should-like-corporate-personhood). The notion that corporate personhood gives corporations the same rights as people, though predating any of the justices that ruled in the case, [is shockingly recent](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/03/hobby-lobby-and-corporate-personhood-heres-the-real-history-of-corporate-rights-in-america.html), and if anything, [corporate personhood should have been an argument *against* Citizens United and other similar cases](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/03/corporations-are-people-and-thats-why-hobby-lobby-should-lose-at-the-supreme-court.html). I have a suspicion that the people who keep anti-CU activists focused on corporate personhood may have ulterior motives.

Ideally, Citizens United would simply be struck down by a more liberal court, but that's not likely anytime soon and isn't guaranteed to happen even under a liberal court. Still, a constitutional amendment should be as simple as affirming Congress' power to regulate election fundraising and/or communications and (if necessary) allowing for the establishment of a public financing system. The constitutionality of election financing regulations has been a fraught topic since [at least 34 years before Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v%2E_Valeo), so something establishing a firm grounding for it would seem to be a worthy goal to pursue.

I will admit that parentheticals like that, especially when I made no mention of your use of the word ""win"", are definitely not going to put me (or others) in a open-minded mindset.

> His opposition (can't say her name, another no no) had oppo research done on him, which involved the use of foreign assets.

This is the first I've heard of this.  Shown sufficient proof I'll happily advocate for prosecution.  That said, that's irrelevant to the topic at hand.  Also, you should really be more judicious with your parentheticals; they're very off-putting.

> He's a non politician who says he would have accepted info from foreign assets ~~too~~.

Note I've crossed out the ""too"" as there was no ""if you knew/thought your opponent was doing so"" in the context of the question to which he was replying when he said that.

> Yeah, his advisors should/would/did advise against it from select foreign assets.

On this we certainly agree.  Well, at least on the should part; I assume neither of us will ever know for sure on the would/did part.  That said, I'd remove the qualifier ""select"" from ""select foreign assets"", or replace it with ""any"".

> I think many people probably appreciate his candor.

I will concede this point, though I find it unfortunate.  I find it both unfortunate that saying whatever comes to mind is appreciated as much as it is, but also that politicians are so notorious for very carefully phrasing what they do say in public such that this came about.  I'd rather have politicians be more candid more often, but also have coherence in what they say.

The comments to which you replied before I chimed in did not seem to ***be*** debating whether or not Trump decided not to escalate the situation.

He didn’t want to work with the west if it killed him, he got the world to revile him at such a level that the _whole world_ sanctioned Iran. He destroyed the weak Iranian economy and turned it to dust, then tried to launch a coup against the Shah who had wisely fled to Iraq. 

Then the US did their thing, spending 30,000 dollars on playing acrobats and body builders to have a march to Teheran (yes, body builders and acrobats.) Intimidating regular people to join them. 

Mossadegh was deposed, the Shah was back and this time thanks to Mossadegh the Shah was much less amenable to democracy seeing that it would get him nothing and lose him everything.

Mossadegh was an autocrat who wanted to replace the Shah with himself. An avid nationalist to the extreme that if seen in any other nation would be seen as an extremist populist authoritarian. 

So don’t go around ”Oh the US couuup!” The west fucked Iran yes but Mossadegh was not one of those times. Deposing Reza Khan in the Anglo-Iranian war is what fucked over Iran, making the younger Reza Shah dependant on foreign diplomats for advice and help is a thing that fucked Iran.

In such a situation, the men will carry out a training scenario, believing it to be reality while ignoring sensory information that contradicts the scenario. In the case of this incident, the scenario was an attack by a lone military aircraft.

Many lower class New Yorkers from a variety of ethnic groups participated. Also, the Confederate sympathies in NYC were largely among the upper crust of society (I.e. people with economic ties to the South feeling the pinch in their wallet because of the war, see Fernando Wood for example). The riots started because of the draft and the policy that wealthy Northerners could buy their way out if they paid a certain amount of money.

The military goes out of its way to make sure people *don't* die (outside of battlefield risks, or course) - they can't just put out a ""help wanted"" ad and get someone who meets all of the qualifications of the person who died. They have to train a replacement from the ground up.

Why are the rich getting richer and the middle class struggling under him? How come the average taxable person is seeing less of a return in tax season? I could post a never ending list of examples as to why the guy is disliked by so many in the US and around the world.

As the people of Iran will only develop more hardline views of America and will be against humanitarian reforms.

What have the civilians of Iran done to deserve this? Nothing. Let them live in peace. Unless you support the butchering of innocent children

The unfortunately inevitable war will not only be illegal, it will be a clusterfuck. Iran is far more developed and armed nation then Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya with geography that is hard to navigate and invade. America is still in those countries, its coming up to the point where Americans can sign up for the military and be sent to a war that started before they were born.

As for paying a 'pornstar' to lie what BULLSHIT (I bet you got that story from CNN or some other fake news organization) and who really cares, she admitted openly that she did not have an affair with Trump, and if she did, good luck to him (no crime committed). He wasn't accused of rape or violence against women (which is a serious crime) like Bill Clinton who most TRUMP detractors just love. It's a pity that charges were not laid earlier against randy old Bill Clinton. I bet you didn't complain about that. As for inheriting half a billion dollars, again, so f_cking what? Good luck to him and his family.

So, yes, it would have dramatically lowered healthcare costs for all, but the idea was ground up, chewed down, and spit out- making those claims of cheaper healthcare for most of the middle class false. And that's not to mention all the ridiculous insurer loopholes and riders and third party healthcare companies inserting themselves into the process, and much more.

The ACA is like a bandaid- it's treating the symptoms without addressing the underlying condition/problem: Healthcare costs are far too high. Unfortunately, while the ACA was being developed a certain party branded it ""Anti-Business"" and then worked to make it illegal not to purchase plans from these big businesses, and *then* bitched about how the changes that ***they*** pushed for insisted on were unconstitutional (/facedesk). All the while a different certain party was *also* receiving ~~bribes~~ ""campaign contributions"", causing infighting under the large umbrella of the party and ultimately weakening their positions.

BUuUuUuUT- Even with all these things complicating the bill, the ACA is **saving lives**. There are countless stories out there of how key aspects of the ACA allowed themselves or their family members access to lifesaving treatments, experts, and/or facilities without which spelled pain and suffering & sometimes even death. Shit, even I have one of those stories and I'm not insured through the marketplace. 

And that's the whole point of it all, really- Access. Is it clumsy and  complicated and costlier to the population as a whole? You betcha. At the very least, we desperately need a public option if we aren't going to provide ""universal"" coverage. But in the meantime we're going to have to endure higher premiums and other butt- fuckings from the insurance companies so that other people (and, yes, occasionally unexpectedly ourselves) can have more time with their mom or brother or whomever. Because it's worth it; it's the right thing to do; it's the kindest option available.

If you're upset about the costs and loopholes, you need to vote for those candidates with a solid plan to move to ""universal coverage"" (which has many different ideas/meanings so you've got to do your research on how the candidates & reps are using the phrase & policies) or a public option. Otherwise the industry is going to roll over the lower middle classes and below.

If they wanted to start a war, shooting down their drone already would warrant a military response. They backed out for a reason. Nobody sane desires a new conflict on scale far larger than the one in Iraq. Iran won’t just roll over. 

You admitted that Iran is taking destabilizing actions against the peace in the Middle East and yet you argue that there is nothing that warrants economic sanctions? So I think you should decide which one is it. Because if Iran is taking actions that are destabilizing the Middle East, then the economic aggression of the US as you call it, is suddenly warranted. 

You really seem dead set on attempting to exonerate Iran by showing everybody else as worse. They are literally responsible for the escalated war in Yemen when they backed the rebel’s against the elected and internationally recognized government. They are backing the murderous regime of Assad. They are funding Hezbollah the extremist organization that wants Israel to be destroyed. They publicly stated they want to destroy Israel, a sovereign country which rights you so valiantly claim to defend. Oh wait, you don’t do that because they aren’t Iran. I already know your response will be how the Saudis are worse etc., how evil Israel and US have been fighting proxy wars for years. But if you can look at today and not at Vietnam from 50 years ago, Iran  is literally starting conflicts in the Middle East, like now and other countries are forced to respond to its actions. I know you won’t admit that because Iran is and always will be innocent in your eyes. Honestly if you are really not convinced by their will to destroy A WHOLE ANOTHER SOVEREIGN NATION, there is nothing that I can say that will change your mind.

8161	1561152839.0	Let me put it this way. I’m aware that the sanctions were imposed because Trump was falsely claiming that Iran was not following through etc. But truth be told, if you have ever looked through the deal it was simply delaying the nuclear weapons, not solving the problem. Iran seems to dead set on building the nuclear weapons and in my view it’s better to act now and try to squeeze them than wait for Israel to start a new war. Because if you look at the history and the stance of Israel, if one thing is certain is that they will be willing to start a war in order to stop Iran from obtains nuclear weapons.	c35akk	2019-06-21 23:33:59

8251	1561127593.0	"> ...that Iran was actively shooting at the USS Vincennes while the incident occurred.

Sure, after Rogers unnecessarily provoked the Iranians by buzzing them with a heli in their waters, then chasing into their waters.

>Under the rules of engagement in effect at the time, the Vincennes’ helicopter, piloted that morning by Lieutenant Mark Collier, should not have been flying close enough to be threatened by the light weapons on the Iranian small craft. If Lieutenant Collier was in danger, it was because he was not following the rules: to approach no closer than four miles. In a letter published last August, in the wake of a Newsweek magazine cover story on the incident, Lieutenant Collier wrote that he was never closer than four miles from the Iranian craft. However, that letter is at variance with Lieutenant Collier’s sworn testimony to the investigators, in which he conceded that he had closed to within two to three miles of the Iranian craft. In fact, when the investigating officer asked Lieutenant Collier, “You were actually inside the CPA [closest point of approach] that you were told not to go inside, is that correct?” Lieutenant Collier replied, “Yes, sir.”

> According to the investigation report, at 0941 Captain Rogers was given permission to open fire. Note, he was now inside Iranian territorial waters and ready to engage boats that had not fired at him. From the data extracted from the Vincennes’ Aegis combat system, the Iranian gunboats did not turn toward the cruiser until 0942—after Captain Rogers had been given permission to fire. Time 0942 is the vital piece of information that destroys the myth that the Vincennes and Elmer Montgomery were under direct attack by a swarm of gunboats.

> From the videotape recorded on Vincennes’ bridge that day, the gunboats, seen as mere specks in the distance, returned fire; they did not initiate the shooting. The Iranian gunboats’ light weapons were greatly outranged by the heavier ordnance on the Vincennes, and the spent shells from the Iranians’ weapons fell harmlessly as a brief line of splashes in the water, hundreds of yards short of the Vincennes, and fully 45 seconds after the Vincennes’ first rounds were fired

A fact that is never mentioned every time this incident is brought up on Reddit. The fact that the gunboats shells didn’t hit them is irrelevant. They were under attack in a war zone. 

Rogers absolutely fucked up in several areas. The IFF should not have identified the aircraft as an F-14, but my point is that there are several mitigating circumstances that provide wider context for why these mistakes occurred. Iran claims that the shootdown was intentional which is why Iranian trolls on Reddit usually portray it as such. While Rogers was negligent (hence why the US paid out compensation to the victims), it was not an intentional act. That is an important differentiation between what happened with the USS Vincennes and other incidents like Korean Air Flight 007 where a military aircraft ID’d the flight as civilian then shot it down anyways."	c35akk	2019-06-22 08:39:39

I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy."" The quote, although unrelated to the downing of the Iranian air liner, has been attributed as such.[53][54][55]"	c35akk	2019-06-21 21:26:00
8258	1561150975.0	"You are fact free.

Its not clear why, but the Iranians sent a passenger airliner flying into an active naval combat zone. Their point of origin was a joint military and civilian air base in Iran. The aircraft could not be contacted and warned off due to some radio frequency issue or mismatch. Despite repeated attempts to warn the plane off, nothing worked and either from some form of horrible luck of by design the plane was going to almost directly fly over the Americans vessel. 

The captain followed standing procedure in shooting that plane down. He waited until the last possible second before firing. If that plane was in fact an Iranian attack jet and he waited any longer he wouldn’t be able to respond to its incoming weapons fire in time to save his ship.

 It was a tragedy, but does the blame really lie with him and the crew or on the idiot at the Iranian airport who decided either from ignorance or malice, to send that plane into a combat zone?

Oh that's so rich, I want to print it on a poster and hang it in my room. You really have no idea do you?

At no point have I defended any of Iran's actions, so here's my best guess as to why you would write that; the media you consume has rotted your brain to the point that you've become a hyperpartisan, tribal jingoist. In your mind any criticism of America gets short circuited into praise for its enemies. That's black and white thinking, and it's a logical fallacy. I can be critical of the country I live in without supporting its enemies.

Not to be outdone by yourself, you also misremembered the nationalities of the ships involved; none of the civilian ships that struck mines were American! One was Japanese and the other was Norwegian.

turning off the transponder doesnt prevent the u.s. or iran from knowing where the drone was.  intentionally preventing a third party from identifying the drones flight path, sets up the stage for a he said she said scenario.  turning off the transponder makes sense if you are trying to provoke a response by violating someones airspace.


there also might be conditions on the omans treaty with the u.s. concerning innocent passage.  if you have a link to the treaty id like to read it.  just because oman signed a treaty allowing the u.s. to pass through and dock at its ports doesnt mean it allowed them to conduct military operations in its territory."	c35akk	2019-06-22 01:07:00

Iran would never have had nukes by 2025, because the deal prevented them from enriching uranium enough to do so, and the independent UN inspectors repeatedly reported that they were complying with the deal, contrary to what you might believe.

Like, I don't know how people don't get this idea. If you're worried about Iran making nukes, then the Iran Deal was a way to monitor them and prevent that from happening. Pulling out of the deal isn't a way to stop them making nuclear weapons in 2025, it's a way to incentivise them to make nuclear weapons right now.

currently there are hundreds of governments and militant groups in the middle east that are funded by the 3 major countries in the world. and typically you see russia and the US funding opposing groups, and China usually funds one or the other depending on their strategic interests at the time.

i  personally see the wars in the middle east as part of the geopolitical ""game"" you are referring to, but i can see how you would think it could be caused by something else considering how tense that area is.

the undeniable fact is the middle east has a lot of different cultural groups vying for regional power/statehood and that is easy to take advantage of by countries with a desire to turn excess wealth directly into power by backing or denouncing certain groups. the middle east has a huge amount of money/weapons funneled into it from elsewhere, which destabilizes the region even further. its a shitty situation all around and there looks to be no end to it tbh

The power imbalance is not as small as a lot of people think. Iran has significant options for retaliation throughout the middle east and they can also put up a pretty intense fight on their border. Their maximum response, if they want to engage it, will likely kill a lot of U.S. troops as it has done in the past under less favorable conditions for them. So further escalation would probably be required from the U.S.

All two of them."	c35akk	2019-06-22 12:23:14
8478	1561169877.0	">Of what? Presidents getting reelected during an active war?

In modern (post-WWII) history. Yes. No other examples other than Bush, or Johnson if you count 64' but ignore 68'. I suppose you could count Obama, but in 2012 while we had several military actions occuring as part of the War On Terror or whatever, we weren't in a war as far as the popular consciousness was concerned, and Obama certainly didn't campaign on it as a major issue.

>but every time an active president has sought reelection during this time, he's gotten it.

Which is meaningless, because Johnson was so unpopular *because of the war* that he resigned and didn't seek reelection. 

The only other example is Bush, and the Iraq war did not help him win reelection, it hurt him somewhat, based on how the issue played in the election. The war was unpopular by January 2004. http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/24/poll.iraq/

Presidents often get a very brief boost in support for a few weeks after some military hostilities occur. That's it. People are extrapolating wildly to assume that it means wartime presidents always get reelected. This is total BS that completely ignores that Johnson of course would not have been reelected."	c35akk	2019-06-22 04:17:57

8487	1561162592.0	"That's because it was supposed to be a ""universal"" healthcare bill (Medicare for all/RomneyCare/etc.) but was so goddamn watered down we ended up with the ACA. So, yes, it would have dramatically lowered healthcare costs for all, but the idea was ground up, chewed down, and spit out- making those claims of cheaper healthcare for most of the middle class false. And that's not to mention all the ridiculous insurer loopholes and riders and third party healthcare companies inserting themselves into the process, and much more.

The ACA is like a bandaid- it's treating the symptoms without addressing the underlying condition/problem: Healthcare costs are far too high. Unfortunately, while the ACA was being developed a certain party branded it ""Anti-Business"" and then worked to make it illegal not to purchase plans from these big businesses, and *then* bitched about how the changes that ***they*** pushed for insisted on were unconstitutional (/facedesk). All the while a different certain party was *also* receiving ~~bribes~~ ""campaign contributions"", causing infighting under the large umbrella of the party and ultimately weakening their positions.

BUuUuUuUT- Even with all these things complicating the bill, the ACA is **saving lives**. There are countless stories out there of how key aspects of the ACA allowed themselves or their family members access to lifesaving treatments, experts, and/or facilities without which spelled pain and suffering & sometimes even death. Shit, even I have one of those stories and I'm not insured through the marketplace. 

And that's the whole point of it all, really- Access. Is it clumsy and  complicated and costlier to the population as a whole? You betcha. At the very least, we desperately need a public option if we aren't going to provide ""universal"" coverage. But in the meantime we're going to have to endure higher premiums and other butt- fuckings from the insurance companies so that other people (and, yes, occasionally unexpectedly ourselves) can have more time with their mom or brother or whomever. Because it's worth it; it's the right thing to do; it's the kindest option available.

If you're upset about the costs and loopholes, you need to vote for those candidates with a solid plan to move to ""universal coverage"" (which has many different ideas/meanings so you've got to do your research on how the candidates & reps are using the phrase & policies) or a public option. Otherwise the industry is going to roll over the lower middle classes and below. They have been and they will continue to do so until the government steps in to pass common-sense regulation *in favor of ***the people*.

And yes, I am saying that this is no reason for economic sanctions. I think you have read that same message elsewhere in my replies as well. Because, Iran is not the only one, there are many actors in the ME cesspool.
I have not exonerated Iran, I have included several actors in this scenario.
Other people in this discussion, like you, only point their finger at Iran. 

Naming all the evil people that Iran backs.... Is still not the reason that the are sanctions now.

And, tell me, who is backing Iran's opponents in these proxy wars? I already gave you a few hints in my previous reply. Should we not attack them too?

The economic sanctions I mentioned, refer to the sanctions that were looming over Iran in case they did not comply with the deal. But, they did comply.

Who pulled out? The US. Why?
All I know is that Trump claims ""it was a bad deal"".

It was agreed upon by many countries, overseen by independent institutions, Iran complied.

Come with me and take a look from another perspective: what would have happened in the ME if Trump would not have pulled out of the nuclear deal?


My guess? The proxy wars would have gone on. 
There would have been no reason to attack Iran, economically or military.


So we get to the point of who is backing the ""right"" people. I have never written about Iran being innocent.
Nor are the other countries that are involved here.

No, I don't think it was just postponing. Iran wants some sort of protection against other players in the region.

In comes Trump: safety gone.

Now Iran tries to get everyone back at the table, by implying they can make nuclear weapons soon. So, let's make a deal, is what I'm thinking.

No need for war. And Europe and China should be looking at Iran as a future ally. Perfectly placed for trade between them. And a strong and stable country in the ME would be very welcome - think Iran before the revolution.

Iranians weren't really pro-Soviet at all, Soviets didn't have a high chance in Iran. All they had to do was to do some anti-Communist adverts similar to stuff they did in U.S. Instead they tried to ""combat communism"" in the most imaginable brutal way possible for people of Iran. U.S was essentially running their own mini-USSR with their own mini-KGB in Iran and now they wonder why Iranians hate U.S.

Also, you don't want the military to act out against [foreign threats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gz08OQUnms)? That's the military's entire purpose. Why would you think anyone would support your reasoning for what's best for the military in regards to trans-people? 

You've linked articles about how the Trump administration thinks trans-people shouldn't be allowed in the military. FYI, all people that take medications, such as trans-people or ADHD people or cancer patients, are not allowed in the military. It's too big of a risk in battle to be without needed medicines.

You've also stated that the ships weren't American so they aren't America's problem. Wrong. The US is responsible for defending Japan as an agreement leftover from WW2 so that they would dissolve their military.

But dessert – dessert crosses all borders, through all cultures, to all peoples. No one doesn’t like dessert of some kind.

>>In 1996, the governments of the United States and Iran reached a settlement at the International Court of Justice which included the statement ""...the United States recognized the aerial incident of 3 July 1988 as a terrible human tragedy and expressed deep regret over the loss of lives caused by the incident..."" As part of the settlement, even though the U.S. government did not admit legal liability or formally apologize to Iran, it still agreed to pay US$61.8 million on an ex gratia basis, amounting to $213,103.45 per passenger, in compensation to the families of the Iranian victims.

Both the US and Iran formally recognized the result of the settlement. It happened 31 years ago.

Meanwhile in 2019, Iran fails to take responsibility or offer explanation for shooting down a drone or striking an oil tanker.

Hang on a second, I've got that backwards and the US is the one doing that.

The point is not to go out and give your enemy an honorable chance at winning - it's that there is no reason to have an enemy at all.

""Non-noble"" wars (i.e. not in self-defense) are significantly more palatable for an electorate when there aren't lives at stake. In other words, the use of drones removes some of the cost of war which may otherwise influence a country's decision to *not* go to war. 

Your questions are hypothetical and there isn't anything wrong with that (I would answer ""no"" to each of them btw) but we can't ignore the context around what we're discussing, which is that the United States faces zero existential military threats.

The human cost of war is a natural deterrent to unnecessary conflict. Removing that cost makes war more attractive. Why would we ever want to make war more attractive? 

Practically I understand that the United States can't just decide to stop using drones tomorrow, but that doesn't mean that it isn't bad for all people that drones are being used.

I think people concretely agree with that.
However, people would disagree on who will get us out of that fucked situation.
If Biden really sticks to his word, and says nothing will fundamentally change, then that means he has no interest in de-escalating the tensions in the middle east, he will not change the tax codes, he will not establish protections of workers, he will not enact laws regarding the environment, he will not do anything about the increasing wage gap.
At the very least, he may enact liberal judges, but many of the core issues that people worry about are not being addressed. That's where I disagree on this part.
We should be working on ensuring a strong candidate wins the Dems primary. If Biden wins, then so be it, we at least tried, and well have to support him, even if we don't like it."	c35akk	2019-06-22 05:10:48

The working class of America is on the edge of patience now. Young voters are angry that centrist shmucks like joe and others are even in the race.

I did, and it does not show anything you wish it did. First off, the US never apologized, never recognized any wrong-doing.

Let that fucking sink in. The USA literally said ""we did nothing wrong"", ""we won't apologize"" and rewarded the guy that did it. And Iran had no choice left anyway than taking the cheap money, what would they do otherwise? Complain once more about laws that are, once again, not respected and not upheld? 

And now you would want other countries to play by the rules that the US refuse to play by? And you call **ME** dense?! 

> offer explanation for shooting down a drone 

They did: ""we shot it down"". That's the explanation. There's none other to have if you have half a decent understanding of the subject: this is a spying drone that was taking intel near Iran costal installations. You spy on a country that you are also threatening to attack, that country will shoot down your spying drones.

&#x200B;

I doubt the Ukrainians would be able to strike Russia if there was a quick mission to seize the nuclear weapons before they could be used. AFAIK the Americans have similar contigencies for Pakistani nuclear weapons, given they're the most unstable nuclear state. Also, there's severe doubts that Ukraine would nuke Russia over losing small pieces like the Crimes and salami-slicing things. Note Nuclear armed South Africa and Israel still got attacked by other states.

&#x200B;

>Also, the attitude of the population doesnt matter as nuclear strikes are in the hands of a few .

&#x200B;

Uh, it does. Any moves that suggest Ukraine gets aligned with NATO means any Russian intervention has significantly more assistance from the population as well as whatever pro-Russian forces are in the Ukrainian military. Because said factions don't want to get nuked or nuke a country they consider as theirs.

&#x200B;

>Any concerns about equipment can resolved by a home grown business. The Ukraine has successfully been able to keep up a domestic nuke industry.

&#x200B;

Keeping it through the 1990s when Ukraine was poor and more disorganized than now will be an issue, especially when stuff starts missing as happened in the case of Russia. Ukraine, being a smaller and poorer state by definition, will have a harder problem with this. Also, before the issues in 2013 or so, there was still a significant amount of cross-country coordination for making tanks and whatnot."	c35akk	2019-06-23 17:42:52

I do agree with the idea that it makes wars more attractive since it lowers the cost, but the same can be said about any military tech. Body armour saves soldier's lives, but there is no debate at all about stripping them from people going into the field. 

But even with wars being costly, this hasn't seemed to stop the US from being involved in a staggering number of them. It seems that cost is one of the least important things on their politician's minds, compared to economic concerns. To me, it looks like these wars are inevitable, and if they're going to happen anyways, I'd rather have them fought by drones as much as possible, if only because that reduces the number of lives senselessly thrown away. 

The idea that drones will increase war reminds me of the old idea that machine guns were such devastating weapons that they would prevent it, just in reverse.

Iran is much more likely to try and avoid escalating this too far. Their goal, IMO, is to get a reaction out of Trump, which would force his Democratic rivals (and likely successors) to take a softer line on Iran as a matter of policy. After all, the Democrats couldn’t advocate being harsh on Iran it that’s what Trump is doing.

> They're going to want to show their defensive capabilities to make the U.S. think twice about the cost of an invasion

So wait, they *are* looking to avoid an invasion? Because you’re saying that this would quickly escalate to a full scale war (IE, invasion). So why wouldn’t they be more cautious in their escalation game? You’re smart, but don’t you think there are smart people in the IRGC too?

Your argument is basically “Iran will retaliate because they don’t want to be invaded, which will lead to invasion”. That doesn’t make much sense.

> I think it would set in motion a series of mutual retaliations that would very quickly escalate to full scale war.

Again, this is only a small retaliatory strike. The ball would then be in Iran’s court, and Iran is clearly going to want to avoid a full scale war.

Nope, you bash on capitalism and no other form of government here. While it has undeniable flaws, it's hardly adult to wave away any point of comparison because you're hellbent on viewing capitalism in a vacuum.

That point about profit, that's real irrelevance. Humanity itself suffers from greed, no matter if they're bound to a central authority or not. Capitalism might enable it more than other forms of government, but since you refuse to talk about any of them, this point is irrelevant as well.

> Also, yes it creates incredible productive capacity, but it simultaneously ensures numerous vast inefficiencies in not only resource production, but resource distribution. 

Ahh, the nuance that has been lacking so far. I'm glad you realise that like all things in life, capitalism is also a coin with two sides.

Tons of crimes, and the report clearly states Trump is not innocent at all.

He was the guy who got Papadopoulos interested in pursuing criminal conspiracy by colluding with Russia, arguably where the collusion started. He told him that Russia had Clinton's emails.

Definitely. They have been since the Bush administration. Regime change in Iran is a big Republican priority and that's not changing.

That's unclear. They didn't need to shoot down that drone. Iran, like most countries, is only a semi-rational country when it comes to dealing with foreign aggression. 

>Their goal, IMO, is to get a reaction out of Trump, which would force his Democratic rivals (and likely successors) to take a softer line on Iran as a matter of policy.

That's certainly one of their goals here, though the Dem candidates all were and are taking softer lines anyways. All of them supported the Iran deal. 

>So wait, they are looking to avoid an invasion? Because you’re saying that this would quickly escalate to a full scale war (IE, invasion). So why wouldn’t they be more cautious in their escalation game? You’re smart, but don’t you think there are smart people in the IRGC too?

Being cautious doesn't guarantee anything, especially if the other party is committed to finding avenues for escalation, which the U.S. seems largely open to pushing. 

>Again, this is only a small retaliatory strike. 

We have no idea what the extent of this strike would have been. And hitting military assets on the mainland in response to the downing of an unmanned drone is a hugely disproportionate response as well as precedent-setting (we haven't bombed Iran before) and would in no way be considered ""small"" by anyone. 

>Why do you think you’re the only one aware of the danger of escalating mutual retaliations? Both US and Iranian officials are aware of that.

Yes, and the U.S. wants escalation, and Iran knows that. So given that, Iran has competing incentives to make their own show of strength, or to shrink back. The more Iran thinks that U.S. escalation is inevetable no matter what they do, the more incentive to try and make the U.S. think twice about the cost of attacking. There's also domestic politics to be concerned about. The Iranian government simply cannot allow the U.S. to drop bombs on their territory and leave that unanswered - that would create a legitimacy crisis for them. It's not at all as simple as saying ""Oh Iran doesn't want to be invaded so therefore they won't provoke the U.S. to do anything further, regardless of what the U.S. does to them."""	c35akk	2019-06-22 02:55:07

9190	1561167125.0	"The reality is that most of those aircraft are effectively worthless. A weak airframe poses unnecessary risk to crew, upkeep is probably one of if not the single biggest cost of aircraft, and aircraft often require multiple man hours of maintenance per flight hour, as well as specialized parts, equipment, and maintainers.

There's next to no civilian applications for worn out, busted up, past-the-end-of-service-life military aircraft besides display or museum pieces. Few countries would be interested in buying them, fewer would be ones we'd actually want to sell them to.

The alternative is scrap them, sell them all to wealthy private enthusiasts which gets rid of maybe 4 in five years, or just let them sit around like old PC parts because we're too attached to realize that they functionally have no value.

Or...Repurpose them to help provide very important training to our military personnel. The *missiles* these things are being blown up with in training are worth more than the aircraft they're hitting. Yeah, sure, a fighter aircraft manufactured in 1960 might have cost $15 million a pop in 1960, but after 30 years of operational use, 20 years as a trainer, and 10 just sitting around, it's not really worth a damn thing as it is beyond the simple scrap value.

It's also not as if every bit of anti-air or air-to-air training conducted by any branch uses converted old aircraft or purpose-built target drones. Live fire tests, especially with missile systems, are rare because the missiles are expensive as fuck.

Some quick googling, a Stinger missile costs $38,000 per missile. That's the man-portable, sometimes vehicle or aircraft mounted SAM/AAM.

An AIM-120 can cost up to *$1,786,000 per missile*, and that's just a modern medium range AAM.

The AAM everyone knows, the Sidewinder, which entered service in 1954, costs $603,817 per missile for a modern production.

You don't just shoot shit that expensive willy-nilly to say, ""Yes, I know how to push a button,"" there's a lot of train-up before a live fire exercise, lots of drill and simulation and classroom instruction etc., and it culminates in actually pulling the trigger. How much training there is is usually appropriately relative to how expensive and how big the shit you're shooting is. And if they're shooting down a 50 year old F-4 Phantom with an almost $2 million missile, I'd bet money the F-4 Phantom is no longer worth anywhere near that in a cost/benefit analysis."	c35akk	2019-06-22 03:32:05

Of those incidents, Carlson commented, ""Why do you want an Aegis cruiser out there shooting up boats? It wasn't a smart thing to do.""

And then immediately retracted and apologized for once the mistake was realized. It was circulated and is widely known the photo was from Obama's administration. 

>That's the issue. A lot of people condem the policy but when they realize they would be criticizing Obama, they delete their tweets. .

You're again are ignoring context and the differences in policies between Obama and Trump. Obama was widely criticized for his immigration and border policies and sued many times over them during his administration. Even so, Obama only separated families for a limited time under limited circumstances. 

Trump has enacted a zero tolerances policy at the border that requires the arrest of anyone coming over the border which then requires the separation by default in order to try to hurt their asylum claims since if he can get the conviction before the asylum claim is processed it hurts their chances. He then also decided to hold asylum seekers in the same camps pending their hearing instead of releasing them as usual which again required their separation and then failed to keep proper track leading to children being adopted away to American families or parents being deported without their children.

There is vital context you're choosing to ignore. Obama was criticized, and rightly so, for many things. Trump is being criticized, and rightly so, for many things. However, comparing the two while ignoring context is disengenuos at best.

I also don't understand this constant need to benchmark Trump's actions against Obama. Trump ran saying he was better than Obama. If he's better as he claims then Obama should never even be mentioned in the same breath let alone used as an excuse ""well, Obama did it""."	c35akk	2019-06-21 20:52:32

The predator also had it's first flight and adoption in 1995 while the RQ4 had its first flight in 1998. So the predator is older.

And all modern planes that aren't model aircraft are controlled with hydraulic motors.

Except if you mean the fact that the RQ4 is capable of autonomous flight along a predetermined route. Which isn't expensive to develop because it flies high where there are no obstacles.

The development costs are something like 4 billion USD. As a comparison the development cost for the A320 in 1984 money was 2.8 billion dollars (calculated with today's exchange rate from € to USD). So it is a rip-off."	c35akk	2019-06-22 05:37:29

Is that the new propaganda talking point you guys are going to try to push? Good luck with that one, because it's definitely not true. Even Dems are starting to admit that it's a crisis that is out of control 

What is it you think I am wrong about? Despite the editorialized headline there, the democrats are not referring to the influx of immigrants as the crisis, they are referring to the humanitarian conditions those migrants are facing as the crisis, and of course many of those conditions were directly caused by Trump. 

Trump referred to the crisis exclusively in terms of the illegal crossings. But of course you already know this. I can only spend so much time responding to obviously disingenuous arguments so I'll stick with your disingenuous arguments about the subject at hand.

>I know most of that shit off the top of my head, but we both know facts and statistics won't matter to you.

Stalling for time while trying to google? Sure. 

>Hahahaha, please tell this to as many people as you possibly can.

I do. Obama kept Iran from restarting their nuclear program for literally zero cost to the U.S.. Basic facts. 

>I was actually referring to the biggest political scandal in the history of this country where the Clinton campaign colluded with Russia and bought Russian disinformation, and then the Obama administration used that disinformation to spy on, and entrap, their political opposition.

Since that didn't happen, I didn't bring it up. Collusion with a foreign government requires the actual involvement of that foreign government. And as the report makes clear, the Fusion GPS info was just a small part of what was used to justify the investigation, not that there is anything wrong with using that info to do so.

>Wow, this is another thing that I would love for you to tell as many people as possible. You'll totally own all the Drumpf supporters if you do.

I mean yeah, this is why Republicans don't like the Mueller report being discussed. Pick a news item from 2016-18 about Collusion that trump called fake news, it's very likely right there in the report as being true. All the biggest components that ended up in the report were widely reported by the media before it came out.

>Defending yourself from an attempted coup is not obstruction

Correct. If an attempted coup ever happened, Trump would be justified in stopping it. 

>Which proves how corrupt and biased Mueller and his gang of corrupt democrat hacks were. Thankfully, Mueller lost what little credibility he had left after that stunt. Who says some shit like that? You have to prove yourself to be innocent now?

No of course not. Trump's not indicted because Mueller pre-determined he wouldn't indict under any circumstances per Justice Dept. policy, remember? Trump is currently under no legal obligation to prove his innocence. 

>Awe man, you were so close! You had the one part right that he was the guy that fed the information to Papadopoulos. Unfortunately you got the connection part wrong. He is definitely connected to government officials, but not the Russians...

No, the report spends quite a bit of time talking about his connections to the Russian government. Do you want me to google that for you?

>Probably just a coincidence tho. Just like Natalia Veselnitskya meeting with Fusion GPS the day before and the day after the Trump tower meeting was just a coincidence. Or the other ""coincidences"" with spies and people with ties to Western intelligence that were sent to entrap the Trump campaign like Stefan Halper, Azra Turk, Alexander Downer,

We can clearly see this is possible by looking at the voter turnout rates for each state and then comparing the type of voter those states are more likely to have.

>the democrats are not referring to the influx of immigrants as the crisis, they are referring to the humanitarian conditions those migrants are facing as the crisis,

What the.....  What kind of mental gymnastics is that...?  The point is, they said it was a manufactured crisis.  Now that they can no longer deny it, Pelosi just said the other day that ""We have never not said there was a crisis"".  Such a joke, and if people weren't suffering it'd actually be kinda funny.

>Trump referred to the crisis exclusively in terms of the illegal crossings.

More lies and propaganda from you.  He has directly addressed the horrors that people crossing the border have to deal with such as human trafficking, violence, sexual assault, kids being trafficked so that people can abuse our weak immigration laws, etc.

>Stalling for time while trying to google? Sure.

Yeah because it's so hard to type in the words ""Obama"", ""decimated"", ""middle class"" on google.  TBH tho, I wanted to concentrate on your defense of treasonous anti American traitors that tried to destroy our democracy (which I guess does most likely include Obama if he was aware of the spying scandal), rather than Obama's multiple failed economic decisions.

>I do. Obama kept Iran from restarting their nuclear program for literally zero cost to the U.S.. Basic facts. 

False, and there is bipartisan condemnation for that joke of a deal.  Very shady circumstances surrounding it too.

>Since that didn't happen, I didn't bring it up.

What part exactly of what I said are you disputing?  That the Clinton campaign paid for Russian disinformation?  That the FBI then vouched for the credibility of the information, to get a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign?

>Collusion with a foreign government requires the actual involvement of that foreign government.

Uh....  Who do you think gave Steele the Russian disinformation...?

>And as the report makes clear, the Fusion GPS info was just a small part of what was used to justify the investigation,

Another lie from you.  This has to be some type of record.  McCabe himself admitted that without that fake dossier, they would not have been able to spy on the Trump campaign.  Just stop lying already.

>not that there is anything wrong with using that info to do so.

What?!?  There's nothing wrong with law enforcement vouching for the credibility of a phony document so that they can spy on a politician they don't like?  What is wrong with you?  TDS really exposes people's true colors.

>I mean yeah, this is why Republicans don't like the Mueller report being discussed.

They don't?  Well I do, and I've heard multiple people such as Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, Doug Colin's, etc. also call for it (but mysteriously the Dems don't seem to be as enthusiastic to force him to testify).  It would highlight how corrupt the whole hoax was.  Mueller needs to testify in front of congress immediately so he can be grilled on his deliberate inaccuracies and omissions.

>Pick a news item from 2016-18 about Collusion that trump called fake news, it's very likely right there in the report as being true.

Oh my God...  You guys are literally brainwashed...  This is honestly scary.  How far removed from reality do you have to be to say something like that?

This comment would exceed the character limit if I listed them all.  It's already long enough because you keep posting false info that I have to correct.

>Trump's not indicted because Mueller pre-determined he wouldn't indict under any circumstances per Justice Dept. policy, remember?

Jesus, you might've broke a record for the amount of fake news in one comment.  Mueller even had to issue a correction (in coordination with AG Barr and the DOJ) saying that was not the reason that Mueller did not find Trump guilty (and there are witnesses that corroborate that).  I don't really blame you for thinking that tho if you only watched his little press conference that he did, because his intent was to trick people like you.

>No, the report spends quite a bit of time talking about his connections to the Russian government. Do you want me to google that for you?

First off, false.  His ties are to western intelligence.

What are you guys going to do after AG Barr's investigation makes all this information common knowledge?

>I've patiently waited for any evidence of ""entrapment"" as opposed to basic counter-intelligence work come to light. I am a very patient guy.

If you are being honest and really want to understand what happened, watch any interview that one of the targets of entrapment, George Papadopoulos, has done in the past couple months (https://youtu.be/ggNWpNZJjNg).  I'm sure you'll just dismiss everything because you probably still believe he's a Russian agent, but at least you'll know what your political opposition is thinking (and like Sun Tzu said, know thy enemy).

Not in terms of the manufactured emergency. He talks about those things generally when he's making his immigation points. The emergency declaration was in relation to the number of crossings.

Here, just read his own official words on it: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-southern-border-united-states/

The ""emergency"" is he can't detain enough people.

How does the fact that politicians criticized it make the fact that it halted the nuclear program false?

Yes. The information they paid for has been mostly verified at this point, and they didn't pay the Russian government for it.

>That the FBI then vouched for the credibility of the information, to get a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign?

Yes. The FBI used additional info beyond the Steele dossier to launch the campaign. That's all in the report. Again, not the the dossier itself was illegitimate to use as supporting info. 

>There's nothing wrong with law enforcement vouching for the credibility of a phony document so that they can spy on a politician they don't like?

>Mueller even had to issue a correction (in coordination with AG Barr and the DOJ) saying that was not the reason that Mueller did not find Trump guilty (and there are witnesses that corroborate that)

What are you talking about? The report includes a whole rationale for why they didn't indict. It's literally the first page. What ""correction"" are you referring to? You're saying he issued a statement that pointed out the entire introduction to his own report was wrong? Yeah, I guess I missed that.

>First off, false. His ties are to western intelligence. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nunes-casts-doubt-on-muellers-findings-about-papadopoulos-tipsters-moscow-links

There's nothing in that article that provides evidence of that other than Nunes' speculation, but assuming he does have ties to western governments I'm not sure how that proves that the Mueller report is lying about his extensive ties to Russia too. People with international government contacts often know people in more than one government. Not sure what you think is so significant here.

>Secondly, the Mueller report barely addressed Joseph Mifsud considering he was such a key player in the scandal. 

His name is mentioned about 80 times in the report. 

But I agree in general that the Mueller report leaves a lot of unanswered questions that are extremely frustrating, including with Mifsud.
